GRE_election_1936_desc:0 "The parliamentary elections of 1936 were the last elections of the inter-war period (Mesopólemos). The return of King George II after the highly disputed referendum of 1935 (97,88% pro monarchy) demanded Constitutional changes that in turn, required a new Boulé."
GRE_georges_dictat:0 "The Dictat of King George II"
GRE_georges_dictat_desc:0 "Following the incapacity of the Venizelists and the anti-Venizelists to form a government due to the dispute of reinstating the democratic officers that took part in the 1935 movement, King George took the initiative and without even informing Demertzis, on the 5th of March he appointed Ioannis Metaxás as Minister of Military Affairs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n§CThis initiative was of great importance, as Metaxás was one of the few polititians that promoted an authoritarian regime.§!"
GRE_escalating_strikes:0 "Dealing with the Strikes"
GRE_escalating_strikes_desc:0 "The escalating crisis with the strikes centered around Thessaloniki must be dealt with fast. Metaxás is a known anti-proponent of the communist ideology and this is a good chance to make an enemy out it and stabilize the nation. However, taking a step back and adopting a more unifying approach might bring better results in the long run."

GRE_the_4th_of_august_regime_desc:0 "Claiming a state of emergency, the danger of domestic upheaval and the global instability, Metaxas called for a ministerial council and announced his decision to postpone indefinitely many aspects of the Constitution. With the acquiescence, Metaxás dissolved parliament and dictatorship ensued."
GRE_domestic_policy:0 "The Sub-Ministries Scheme"
GRE_domestic_policy_desc:0 "Our kathestos is formally a duumvirate, yet the rains should only be in Metaxás' hands. Establishing parallel ministries, we can replace the royalists with our own loyal people. These sub-ministries will hold more power than other ordinary ministries, and from their deliberately humble denomination, one will not be able to deduct that they are in fact the pillars of the regime."
GRE_domestic_policy_tt:0 "§CThe plan dictates a total of 15 Ministries and 10 Sub-Ministries to co-exist, of which, Metaxás will assume the responsibility of five§!"
GRE_foreign_policy:0 "The Self-Appointed Minister of Foreign-Affairs"
GRE_foreign_policy_desc:0 "By proclaiming himself as the foreign policy minister, Metaxás will be able to control the country's foreign relations, even further isolating the King.

They are only some of what we've achieved and many more at to come."
GRE_public_works_desc:0 "Contrary to the popular belief that Metaxás’ regime was primarily one of militarism and military ideals, like the rest of dictatorships across Europe, the truth was that such ideals were so apparent only because of the harsh circumstances Greece found herself into. In reality, Metaxás would not follow other dictators into wearing his uniform but instead opted for his suit (and his cane)."

GRE_four_year_plan_2_desc:0 "Metaxás' policy was one of armed neutrality. Believing that a second world war was to come and devoid of any illusions that the international community would protect his nation, his choice of armed neutrality only seemed a reasonable one. The army and the industry must be further expanded upon, no matter the political cost."
GRE_launch_IKA:0 "Launch IKA"
GRE_launch_IKA_desc:0 "The Social Insurance Institute was mainly a demand of the workers. It was voted by Venizelos' government yet the law wasn't put in practice due to the government collapsed. IKA opened its doors on December 1st, 1937 after a decree from Metaxás."

GRE_the_italian_question_desc:0 "The occupation of the Dodecanese, the conquering of Corfu in 1923, even the brewing tensions with the Albanians make the Italians and their leader Benito Mussolini our enemy. An enemy we did not choose, yet one we must face nevertheless."

#GRE_the_gruesome_decision_desc:0 "18 of March, 1939. The following week was the week of passions. British note further debts and my suspicion they will ask for my downfall. Concerns for the role Tsouderós has. King in favor, but Hellas cannot pay. Sudden threat of Romania by Germans- British announce on Friday. Asking for an answer by Saturday. War? Coordination with the allies? After the night of Saturday, Romanians refute everything. Seems Gafencu asked Britain for help, but by Friday they compromised with the Germans. Hallifax refuted. Turks replied so-so, my suspicions are shown to be true. What a week, will Mussolini move? Can he not move? What will we suffer? My worries are strenuous tonight."

GRE_eon_2_desc:0 "The National Youth Organization (EON) was officially founded on September 5, 1936, yet some complications did not allow it to exist untill the next year. EON was the brainchild of Metaxás. At the beginning, King George II was against the idea of starting up EON but later Metaxas convinced him to be the honorary leader of the organization and eventually agreed."

GRE_metaxas_military_affairs_desc:0 "The position of Minister of War / Minister of Military Affairs was one given to Metaxás by King George II and it is one he is not keen on giving up upon yet. The country is in disarray, the army is in dire need of mass reforms, but even worse, the sentiments of ideologies still threaten the nation’s stability. It is vital for the government to step in and take action, before it is too late."
GRE_recruit_the_fascists_2:0 "The Influence of the Fascist Standards"
GRE_recruit_the_fascists_2_desc:0 "There is undeniably a strong influence of the German, the Italian, even the Portuguese protocol in our regime. However, ours contains no racism nor chauvinism, aggressive nationalism and anti-Semitism.

GRE_establish_asfaleia_desc:0 "The Greek Himmler- his opponents call him. Konstantinos Maniadákis may not have been Archigós' first choice, but he will certainly suffice.

GRE_third_hellenic_civilization:0 "Dreams of a Glorious Past"
GRE_third_hellenic_civilization_desc:0 "Our ancient history, the spirits of Athens, Corinth, Macedon and Sparta have been a pole of attraction to almost every nation, fascists one included.

GRE_an_orthodox_state:0 "An Orthodox State"
GRE_an_orthodox_state_desc:0 "Metaxás views Orthodoxy as the religion of the nation and therefore it’s a core element of the regime’s ideology. This doesn’t mean however the persecution of other religions. In fact, it is the political background of religions that turned the regime against them. EON may only accept orthodox Christians, yet applications of others are taken into consideration."
