GRE_election_1936_desc:0 "The parliamentary elections of 1936 were the last elections of the inter-war period (Mesopólemos). The return of King George II after the highly disputed referendum of 1935 (97,88% pro monarchy) demanded Constitutional changes that in turn, required a new Boulé."
GRE_georges_dictat:0 "The Dictat of King George II"
GRE_georges_dictat_desc:0 "Following the incapacity of the Venizelists and the anti-Venizelists to form a government due to the dispute of reinstating the democratic officers that took part in the 1935 movement, King George took the initiative and without even informing Demertzis, on the 5th of March he appointed Ioannis Metaxás as Minister of Military Affairs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n§CThis initiative was of great importance, as Metaxás was one of the few polititians that promoted an authoritarian regime.§!"
GRE_escalating_strikes:0 "Dealing with the Strikes"
GRE_escalating_strikes_desc:0 "The escalating crisis with the strikes centered around Thessaloniki must be dealt with fast. Metaxás is a known anti-proponent of the communist ideology and this is a good chance to make an enemy out it and stabilize the nation. However, taking a step back and adopting a more unifying approach might bring better results in the long run."
GRE_the_4th_of_august_regime:0 "Kathestós ths 4hs Augoústou"
GRE_the_4th_of_august_regime_desc:0 "Claiming a state of emergency, the danger of domestic upheaval and the global instability, Metaxas called for a ministerial council and announced his decision to postpone indefinitely many aspects of the Constitution. With the acquiescence, Metaxás dissolved parliament and dictatorship ensued."
GRE_domestic_policy:0 "The Sub-Ministries Scheme"
GRE_domestic_policy_desc:0 "Our kathestos is formally a duumvirate, yet the rains should only be in Metaxás' hands. Establishing parallel ministries, we can replace the royalists with our own loyal people. These sub-ministries will hold more power than other ordinary ministries, and from their deliberately humble denomination, one will not be able to deduct that they are in fact the pillars of the regime."
GRE_domestic_policy_tt:0 "§CThe plan dictates a total of 15 Ministries and 10 Sub-Ministries to co-exist, of which, Metaxás will assume the responsibility of five§!"
GRE_foreign_policy:0 "The Self-Appointed Minister of Foreign-Affairs"
GRE_foreign_policy_desc:0 "By proclaiming himself as the foreign policy minister, Metaxás will be able to control the country's foreign relations, even further isolating the King.

They are only some of what we've achieved and many more at to come."
GRE_public_works_desc:0 "Contrary to the popular belief that Metaxás’ regime was primarily one of militarism and military ideals, like the rest of dictatorships across Europe, the truth was that such ideals were so apparent only because of the harsh circumstances Greece found herself into. In reality, Metaxás would not follow other dictators into wearing his uniform but instead opted for his suit (and his cane)."

GRE_four_year_plan_2_desc:0 "Metaxás' policy was one of armed neutrality. Believing that a second world war was to come and devoid of any illusions that the international community would protect his nation, his choice of armed neutrality only seemed a reasonable one. The army and the industry must be further expanded upon, no matter the political cost."
GRE_launch_IKA:0 "Launch IKA"
GRE_launch_IKA_desc:0 "The Social Insurance Institute was mainly a demand of the workers. It was voted by Venizelos' government yet the law wasn't put in practice due to the government collapsed. IKA opened its doors on December 1st, 1937 after a decree from Metaxás."

GRE_the_italian_question_desc:0 "The occupation of the Dodecanese, the conquering of Corfu in 1923, even the brewing tensions with the Albanians make the Italians and their leader Benito Mussolini our enemy. An enemy we did not choose, yet one we must face nevertheless."

Concerns for the role Tsouderós has. King in favor, but Hellas cannot pay. Sudden threat of Romania by Germans- British announce on Friday. Asking for an answer by Saturday. War? Coordination with the allies? After the night of Saturday, Romanians refute everything. Seems Gafencu asked Britain for help, but by Friday they compromised with the Germans. Hallifax refuted.

GRE_eon_2_desc:0 "The National Youth Organization (EON) was officially founded on September 5, 1936, yet some complications did not allow it to exist untill the next year.

The country is in disarray, the army is in dire need of mass reforms, but even worse, the sentiments of ideologies still threaten the nation’s stability. It is vital for the government to step in and take action, before it is too late."

GRE_establish_asfaleia_desc:0 "The Greek Himmler- his opponents call him. Konstantinos Maniadákis may not have been Archigós' first choice, but he will certainly suffice.

GRE_an_orthodox_state:0 "An Orthodox State"
GRE_an_orthodox_state_desc:0 "Metaxás views Orthodoxy as the religion of the nation and therefore it’s a core element of the regime’s ideology. This doesn’t mean however the persecution of other religions. In fact, it is the political background of religions that turned the regime against them. EON may only accept orthodox Christians, yet applications of others are taken into consideration."

Another old acquittance of Metaxas involved was Theodoros Tourkovassilis, a pro-German fanatic who had been one of the co-founders of the Freethinkers party nearly twenty years ago. Other members of the conspiracy were anti-Venizelist politicians such as Stephanos Stephanopoulos, Dimitris Polyzos, Petros Rallis, Pericles Rallis and Sotirios Gotzamanis. The main supporter in the Army was Lieutenant-General Constantine Platys. Seemingly the plot was secretly funded by the Germans, who wanted Greece on their side, through Egon Kontoumas, a Greek-German businessman and chemical engineer with Nazi leanings. He acted as liaison between the pro-Axis Greeks and their Nazi patrons in Germany. The time to take some action has come. The ringleaders and their accomplishes have all been identified.

During the Balkan Wars he served his military service. He had been a collaborator of Metaxas in the Freethinkers Party, but later switched to the Liberals, which earned him the epithet of an ‘adventurist’. In 1934 he was elected Mayor of Athens. Kotzias has been a fan of Benito Mussolini’s fascism. In addition, Kotzias is an overt supporter of Hitlerism in Greece, and had attempted to found a youth movement on Hitler’s model in Greece before. As one of the main supporters of Nazism in Greece, he established powerful contacts with the German regime. In fact, Kotzias had a friendly relationship with both Goering and Goebbels and he is one of the few Greeks to have met Hitler personally. He is known in Berlin to be the “perfect advertiser” of the Nazi ideology in Greece. The British viewed him as the Greek Goering, and Goebbels described him as a true friend of the German people."

He created an immense industrial empire with weapons factories, mines and plants in diverse branches of industry in the 1930s. Born to an ethnic Greek family in the region of Bor, Cappadocia, Asia Minor in 1890, Prodromos migrated to Greece after the Greco-Turkish War (1919–22). A very smart brain, since 1934 he controlls Pyrkal, one of the oldest Greek defence industries. Bodosakis and Metaxas were introduced in early 1934 by Emmanouel Tsouderos, then Governor of the Bank of Greece. The two met at the offices of the Greek telephone company and discussed the possibility of Bodosakis employing Metaxas’ son-in-law, Georgios Mantzoufas.

In 1924, she came to Greece, where she adopted a naive nationalist and conservative approach to her work. Her style coincides with the Greek state’s need to produce an ideal view of the country and its people, for internal as well as external purposes (mainly tourism). In this respect, Nelly can be seen as the first Greek “national” advertiser. She is usually referred to as Nelly’s (nobody knows why, perhaps to replicate the Byzantine icon-painters who signed with their name in the genitive case to indicate that the ‘writing’ of the icon was by their own hand).

She was in Germany when Adolf Hitler was struggling to achieve power, and there she embraced National Socialist ideas. When the Nazis finally came to power on January 30, 1933, she was appointed executive at the Ministry of Propaganda. Joseph Goebbels appreciated the education and qualifications of a “young Greek woman,” as she called her, and Alfred Rosenberg frequently mentioned the training of a “Greek collaborator” in the Enlightenment department. According to reports, Sitsa Karaiskaki was also chosen by the Abwehr chief (and a descendant of the Greek Kanaris family) Wilhelm Von Canaris to become an associate of the German secret intelligence service in the field of propaganda. In 1933, together with the lawyer Evangelos Kyriakis and the author Kyriakos Karamanos, she founded the publishing house “Nea Genea”. An important book published by the editorial was the political diary of Joseph Goebbels titled “From the Kaiserhof to the Reich Chancellery”. Other published books were “Jews and Communism” by Hermann Fest in 1934, “Mental and spiritual poison – The essence and spirit of Bolshevism” or “The war against religion and the Church”. Also in 1934, Karaïskaki, who wrote both in Greek and German, wrote and published her book “Das dritte Reich durch meine Brille” (“The Third Reich through my glasses”), referring to the events of her contemporary time and “the achievements of the National Socialist government”."

His relationship with Metaxas began many years before August 4, 1936 – they were acquaintances from the days of the failed counter-revolutionary movement of 1923. Their relations were restored during the dictatorship, when Metaxas appointed Diakos as a minister without portfolio. From that position Diakos became a successful power broker, a political fixer and a influential adviser for Metaxas. His role raised suspicions among many. The English ambassador to Athens considered him “a sinister and shadowy figure”. In the same vein, the Foreign Office described him as “the ’eminence grise’ of the dictatorship, [who attended] all cabinet meetings, and [controlled] large industrial and financial interests” and described him as “…an able, unscrupulous and aggressive schemer”, while the historian PJ Vatikiotis regarded him as “a strange and mysterious figure, highly influential in the government of Metaxas as the major rival of the other strong personality in that government, Kostas Kotzias”. Besides being one of Metaxas’ closest associates, Diakos was also the chief go-between the dictator and the financial and business circles, and the closest link between Metaxas and the arms sales."
