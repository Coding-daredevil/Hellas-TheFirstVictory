 hellenic_news.1.desc:1 "The elections seemed like a cauldron set on fire. Kómma Filelefthérwn (Liberals) emerged as the largest party in the Parliament, winning 126 out of 300 seats. However, just 20.86% of the legal population came in to vote and even worse, the end result is an equilibrium between the KF (Venizelists) and Laikón Kómma (Anti-Venizelists). The country is facing a deadlock and Demertzis and his cabinet are to stay in power until the two sides come into a consensus."

 hellenic_news.2.desc:1 "Seizing the initiative, King George surprises everyone by appointing former general and military genius Ioannis Metaxás as the Minister of War. It is considered a very significant move on behalf of King George, partially because Metaxas is a known royalist, but mostly because he is one of few politicians that support an authoritarian, non-parliamentary regime.

 hellas.1.t:0 "The dreadful 9th of May"
 hellas.1.desc:0 "The epicenter of this earthquake is none other than Thessaloniki. The worker’s movement has been demonstrating ferociously on the streets. Metaxás is thinking of a harsh crackdown, that however could lead to deaths. In turn, our regime could be stigmatized domestically and in foreign circles. Perhaps a more unifying approach could work?"
 hellas.1.a:0 "Follow the plan, suppress all troublemakers."
 hellas.1.b:0 "Adopt a milder approach, still make them disperse."
 hellas.1.c:0 "Let's listen to what they have to say..."
 hellas.2.t:0 "The 4th of August Regime is proclaimed!"
 hellas.2.desc:0 "Claiming a state of emergency, the danger of domestic upheaval and the global instability, Metaxas called for a ministerial council and announced his decision to postpone indefinitely many aspects of the Constitution. With the acquiescence, Metaxás dissolved parliament and dictatorship ensued. The communist paper Rizospástis has been banned and certain members of KKE, like Vasílis Vervéris and Manólis Manoléas, have been arrested."
 hellas.2.a:0 "Chaire Archige!"
 hellas.3.t:0 "The Influence of the Fascist Standards."
 hellas.3.desc:0 "Although there is an undeniable influence of the strong, firm fascist regimes of Europe, Metaxás is not a proponent of fascism. His realpolitik and realism with which he approaches every situation are more similar to the European mindset. Yet his goal is one of a purely Hellenic path, towards a great future. Not of revanchism, but of civilization. Or so he claims. The future still lies ahead."

 hellas.3.b:0 "Realign with the German mindset."
 hellas.4.t:0 "The Cretan Uprising"
 hellas.4.desc:0 "A Coup d'état attempt has taken place on the island of Crete, with the city of Chania as its epicenter. It seems our Asfáleia was unprepared for it and slipped its grasp. Thankfully, due to bad organization the coup collapsed within hours after our timely action. The question now is, how shall we act? Metaxás is considering a tolerant approach"
 hellas.4.a:0 "Follow the plan"
 hellas.4.a_tt:0 "After a month, a series of court martials will take place on Chania, yet through the tolerant attitude of the dictator the main conspirators will flee to Cyprus while the rest will be condemned and exiled. An amnesty will be given after a year. No death penalty will be given. §C\n This action will build relations with Republicans/Communists§!."

 hellas.5.t:0 "The New Archbishop of Athens"
 hellas.5.desc:0 "A new archbishop is to be elected in Athens. The two main contenders are Damaskinos of Corinth and Chrysanthos of Trebizon. The former is a leading opponent of the regime and, although Metaxas has adopted a neutral stance regarding the electoral procedure, he is indeed much closer to Chrysanthos, who is also clearly favored by the King, George II. The voting saw Damaskinos receive 31 votes while Chrysanthos 30, effectively making Damaskinos the elected archbishop of Athens and primate of Greece. But this doesn’t have to be the case. Metaxás has a plan…"
 hellas.5.a:0 "Follow the plan"
 hellas.5.a_tt:0 "This is a blatant anti-Metaxas movement and we have to crush it. We can send Damaskinos to exile In a monastery and forcefully put Chrysanthos on top with a decree. §C\n This action will worsen relations with Republicans§!."
 hellas.5.b:0 "Avoid action"

If Greece accepts the invitation, the Germans are certain to intervene in favor of the Italians. There is also much doubt on the quantity of the Allied assistance as the transfer of divisions from Egypt will be limited. The British indeed offered a lot less divisions than what the Prime Minister had asked for. On the other hand, pursuing the war alone (at least on papers) and achieving key victories, could potentially open a diplomatic route to end hostilities."

The Germans might help a bit too'. The lad pauses, but quickly, he adds as he recalls. 'Oh, if you can't see the threshold that's because your civilian intel over the Italians is too low.

 hellas.301.desc:0 "Metaxas’s Minister-Governor of Athens, Kostas Kotzias, contributed to a German publication of the year 1938, entitled Unsterbliches Hellas (Immortal Greece), with an article titled “Die griechische Jugend durch die Jahrhunderte” (The Greek Youth through the Centuries). The book was a high-flying effort. Prefaces to the book were written by Alexander Rizos-Rangavis, Greek ambassador in Berlin, and Alfred Rosenberg, one of the renown intellectuals of the Nazi party and the Kommissar for Supervision of Intellectual and Ideological Education of the NSDAP. Metaxas himself dedicated one of his portraits writing “Für das Buch `Unsterbliches Hellas’."
 hellas.301.a:0 "This is beneficial indeed"
 hellas.302.t:0 "Junges Griechenland"
 hellas.302.desc:0 "Alfred Widenmann, a German film director, screenwriter and author of children's books, has written a book based upon our nation. Young Greece, as it is translated, is attributed to our Youth, EON and consists of a variety of photographic material. It is certainly a great way to advertise ourselves to the average German citizen, as we are presented as the continuators of our great ancestors."
 hellas.302.a:0 "Have we enchanted them?"
 hellas.303.t:0 "Thessaloniki International Exhibition"
 hellas.303.desc:0 "The 11th International Exhibition of Thessaloniki has taken place between the 06-17 of September, 1936. Prime Minister Metaxás gave an important speech, emphasizing that his government will do everything within its power to arm and organize the defence forces of the nation."
 hellas.303.a:0 "Seems we've gotten a reaction"
 hellas.304.t:0 "Inonu's urgent visit to Athens!"
 hellas.304.desc:0 "Secret talks have taken place between the Bulgarians and Yugoslavians. Ismet Inonu has been worried that the matter discussed has something to do with the partioning of Greece and thus has rushed in Athens to talk directly with the Prime Minister. Things are looking urgent."
 hellas.304.a:0 "Support the talks"
 hellas.304.b:0 "Take a few steps back"
 hellas.305.t:0 "Metaxás’ visit to Constantinople"
 hellas.305.desc:0 "One of Metaxás’ main goals has been to solidify the Thracian borders. To that end talks with the Turks have opened, yet we haven't gained much. Lately, Metaxás visited Constantinople to further expand upon this topic, but yet again, nothing of particular value was gained"
 hellas.305.a:0 "Maybe next time"
 hellas.306.t:0 "Metaxás welcomes Turks in Athens"
 hellas.306.desc:0 "Finally, on the 27th of April, 1938, the inviolable of the borders in Evros has been signed between Greece and Turkey, further expanding upon the 1930 and 1933 treaties. This "Additional Greco-Turkish Treaty" as it has been called, also ensures the neutrality of each side in case the opposite is under attack from a third country, while also promising not to become a base of operations for the enemy."

 hellas.307.desc:0 "As a sign of respect and desire to leave the past behind, prime minister Metaxás has attended the funeral of Turkey's leader Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. After the funeral, the Prime Minister met Inonu and both agreed into forming a common front inside the Balkan Pact. However, Saracoglu violated the agreement, directly supporting the Bulgarian exit in the Aegean. The Prime Minister writes on his diary:"
 hellas.307.a:0 ""I was left awake, everything collapses""
 hellas.308.t:0 "Metaxás visits Belgrade upon invitation from Regent"
 hellas.308.desc:0 "At some point, Paul Karageorgevich confided to Metaxás the conspiracy that he had lately uncovered. The Bulgarian Premier, Gheorgi Kioseivanov, had broken the special treaty he had signed with Greece and when he met his counterpart, Milan Stojadinovic, in Nis on Noember 1st, 1938, he proposed the partition of Greece. Thrace would be given to Bulgaria and Thessaloniki to the Yugoslavians. If that wasn't enough already, the Regent also revealed the two-faced policy of the British through ambassador Loraine in Turkey, who sought a Bulgarian exit in the Aegean."
 hellas.308.a:0 "We should immediately reprimand the British"
 hellas.309.t:0 "Formal Protest over the British Transgressions"
 hellas.309.desc:0 "The British have struck a nerve with their actions against us. Our countries have been allies for so many wars, yet their policy of appeasement wants us to suffer an irreversible humiliation just so the Bulgars won't join their German friends on the upcoming conflict. They should realize who their true allies are and fast."
 hellas.309.a:0 "Insist heavily on the protests"
 hellas.3095.t:0 "British recall Loraine and apologize"
 hellas.3095.desc:0 "It seems our actions have had the desirable effect. The British have formally withdrawn Loraine from the position of the ambassador and apologized for his stance."

 hellas.312.t:0 "Metaxás declared his intentions to the Romanian FM"
 hellas.312.desc:0 "The Romanian Foreign Minister, Grigore Gafencu, has visited Athens. During their meeting, Gafencu noted the following: The only task Metaxás is willing to pursue, is to arm Greece and make her capable to defend herself. "If I was forced", he said, "to oppose the adamant eros that my people have for freedom, I only did so they could keep their national independence. For the times that are about to come, will no longer be beneficial to small nations. Everywhere the "New Order" insults our most beloved ideas. Towards the tendencies of assimilation through force, our fatherlands are under constant threat. It seems that nations have become worthless. Yet, what greater thing can there be in this world but our little homelands?" Reportedly, he pointed his hand at the temple of Athena in Sounio and with a transparent, proudful simplicity said:"
 hellas.312.a:0 ""There, Europe started. And there it could end, were we not to constantly stay vigilant.""
 hellas.313.t:0 "A talk with Emanuele Grazzi"
 hellas.313.desc:0 "During their meeting in 21st of August 1939, Metaxás declared his intentions of Italian ambassador in Greece, Emanuele Grazzi. Grazzi complained for the presence of the Greek army in the Border region after the Italian occupation of Albania. On a serious temper, Metaxás informed Grazzi that things were not as he had mentioned. Greece should be able to defend herself from any attempt over the integrity of her borders and he would act likewise against the British if he had to."
 hellas.313.a:0 "The Italians are looking for a ruse"
 hellas.314.t:0 "Friendship Declaration with the Italians"
 hellas.314.desc:0 "It seems that politics are full of hypocricy. Very well, if that helps us postpone the Italian invasion, then so be it. We shall take any chance we get, explore every possible route to avoid a conflict with Mussolini. Perhaps we can succeed."
 hellas.314.a:0 "Perhaps"
 hellas.315.t:0 "Grazzi's 7th Calling"
 hellas.315.desc:0 "On the 7th of August 1940, Metaxás called Grazzi for the 7th time. All this time he hadn't lost an opportunity to call the Italian ambassador and clear things out, making sure that the Italians won't get the ruse they so much hope for. This time however, he called Grazzi to complain for the non-friendly stance of Italy in the case of the Greek consul, Skárpas, in Geneva. Grazzi attempted to go on the counterattack, blaiming the Greek side for allowing british ships to use the Greek flag. Through an array of arguments Metaxás shut Grazzi down. Grazzi left ensuring Metaxás that Mussolini and Ciano had an absolute friendly dispotition towards the Greek state. Yet, on the 11th of August, the Premier notes on his diary:"

 hellas.316.a:0 "A Great Success!"
 hellas.317.t:0 "The Plot of the Germanophilles"
 hellas.317.desc:0 "For a while, the plot has been under close observation of the almighty security guard of the regime, Maniadakis, who informed Metaxas almost daily about the activities and discussions of those involved in the conspiracy. Metaxas took the threat seriously and attentively followed the events. The plot finally materialized on June 3rd 1940. With a tough move with the help of Maniadakis’ well-oiled machinery, Metaxas swept all the conspirators within a few hours. Platys was arrested, was subjected to constant interrogations and eventually banished, while all the other conspirators were arrested and put behind bars or into exile. Kontoumas was forced to leave Greece in order not to be arrested and avoid a diplomatic incident, while Metaxas closed the offices of a German-speaking newspaper in Athens, where talks on the conspiracy had been held. Even some pro-Axis members of the EON were ousted. The most alarming thing for Metaxas however was that the whole plot was known to his closest associate Kostas Kotzias, who seemed to be entertaining the idea of succeeding him and lead Greece into the Axis side. However, after the events Kotzias presented himself to Metaxas and assured him of his total loyalty to him, but the Cephalonite only accepted his pledges bitterly, as his trust on his old close associate had now cracked."

Goebbels is said to have writen in his diary that he considers his days in Greece to be among the happiest in his life and that he was enchanted by his encounter with the remnants of the ancient Greek civilization. It is worth noting that Goebbels insisted on visiting Sparta, which is of important symbolic value both to Metaxas and the Nazis"

Beyond the shortages in munititions and materiel, our soldiers are getting even more tired by the day. Our supply system is god-awful as well thanks to the mountainous terrain and no matter how many women and children carry supplies to our soldiers, it will never be enough.

This has come at a cost of extraordinary sacrifices from our side, but it was all for good. The Hellenic Government now faces a new dillema. To continue the war to its very end, or to seek an alternative. The first scenario certainly looks bleak. On the other hand, the Germans have already approached us, humbly inquiring on what it would take to close this front once and for all and put an end to this undesirable war. They have certainly implied that the Italians would be forced to collaborate, everyone else as well."

The King himself said there was a dispute, albeit a mild one. It is said that Koryzis left the meeting devastated, picking his coat after suddenly kissing his hands and headed to his house in Vasilissis Sofias avenue. Worrying for him, the King sent his hair Paulos after him (another report speaks of Diakos). While speaking with Koryzis' wife in the entrance, two gunshots were heard from the first floor. The circumstances around the death of the prime minister, have lead to the dispute of his suicide. Being a right-handed man, it was very peculiar that he used his left hand to shoot himself twice, which alone is a very, very rare event. In addition, there hasn't been an official autopsy for the causes of his death, while the Orthodox church that by dogma denies burial rights for people who suicided, agreed to bury Koryzis in normal fashion. Some say Koryzis couldn't stand the pressure. Some that he was accused of treason, as there was a leak and both the King and the British accused him of it. Another rumor has it that Koryzis fell in love with a woman that was proven to be a German spy and humilitation armed his hand.

He rushed to sign a cease-to-all hostilities pact with LSSAH-commander Sepp Dietrich. Tsolakoglou was so determined to deny the Italians the satisfaction of a victory they never won, that he begun talks without having an order to do so. The surrender was to be made only to the Germans. Hitler personally agreed and attempted not to include the Italians. A truce would be called for 10 days, where the Greek army would be allowed to leave Albania without the Italians pursuing them. After disarming them, all soldiers would be allowed to return home as non-prisoners, while the officers would keep their arms in honor. Sadly, the Germans did not keep their promises. During the signature, they were ruthlessly bombing Ioannina. A second treaty was signed when General von List learned about the treaty, with much worse conditions this time. Tsolakoglou signed as a prisoner with no free will, surrending however the army only to the Germans. Mussolini was so irritated by this that he ordered immediate attacks on the Greek forces, but they were repelled. Only when he himself reached out to Hitler, was a truce achieved with Italy as a member. The final treaty was signed on [?GRE.treaty_signed_date.GetDateStringNoHour].

Fearing reprisals, the locals spent the night in the fields and sent a delegation to the Italian commander in Arta to explain the situation.

On the previous night, the regiment commander Oberst Josef Salminger had given them a short, fierce speech alleging that they were going to wipe out a partisan nest and ordering them to spare no one. Most of the men had been fighting in the Eastern Front and they were accustomed to carrying out similar reprisals against the local population. The soldiers surrounded the village from three directions, leaving unattended only the access to the Arachthos river. Houses were first attacked with grenades and as villagers awoke and tried to flee, they were indiscriminately shot at. Many women, children and elderly fell victims.

During the operation, 78 German soldiers, who had been taken prisoner by the guerrillas in October, were executed by their captors. In response, the commander of the German division, General Karl von Le Suire personally ordered the "severest measures" — the killing of the male population of Kalavryta — on 10 December 1943. Operation Kalavryta was mounted from six cities: Patras, Aigion, and Corinth on the Gulf of Corinth and from Argos, Pyrgos and Tripolis in central Peloponnese. Wehrmacht troops burnt villages and monasteries and shot civilians on their way. The Germans reached Kalavryta on December 9. In the early morning of December 13, 1943 the Germans rounded up all residents of the town and forced them into the school building where they separated the older boys and men from the women and children. They moved the men to a field owned by Thanasis Kappis, a school teacher, just overlooking the town. After looting the town and setting it ablaze, the Germans machine-gunned the men. 438 men and older boys were killed. There were only 13 male survivors, saved because they were hidden under the bodies of the dead. Austrian soldiers were part of the contingent. The next call of order was to lock rounded up women and children into a primary school. After doing so the Germans set the school on fire. There was one Austrian man who disobeyed orders & opened doors to the blazing school, knowing he would sacrifice his life, for women and children to escape. He was later executed for his acts of treason, but the victims escaped. The following day the Nazi troops burned down the Agia Lavra monastery, a landmark of the Greek War of Independence. In total, 693 civilians were killed during the reprisals of Operation Kalavryta. Twenty-eight communities—towns, villages, monasteries and settlements—were destroyed.

On 1 May 1944, 200 Greek communists ("The 200 of Kaisariani") were executed at the firing range of the Athens suburb of Kaisariani by the Nazi occupation authorities as reprisal for the killing of a German general by Greek Resistance forces. The pamphlet is titled: This blood too falls on your head."

 hellas.2016.desc:0 "On June 10, 1944, for over two hours, Waffen-SS troops of the 2nd company, I/7 battalion, 4th SS Polizei Panzergrenadier Division under the command of the 26-year-old SS-Hauptsturmführer Fritz Lautenbach went door to door and massacred Greek civilians as part of "savage reprisals" for a partisan attack upon the unit's convoy. A total of 228 men, women and children were killed in Distomo, a small village near Delphi. According to survivors, SS forces "bayoneted babies in their cribs, stabbed pregnant women, and beheaded the village priest." However, another source refers to "the 1,000 citizens slaughtered by the Germans". Following the massacre, a Secret Field Police agent accompanying the German forces informed the authorities that, contrary to Lautenbach's official report, the German troops had come under attack several miles from Distomo and had not been fired upon "with mortars, machine-guns and rifles from the direction of Distomo". An inquiry was convened. Lautenbach admitted that he had gone beyond standing orders, but the tribunal found in his favour, holding that he had been motivated, not by negligence or ignorance, but by a sense of responsibility towards his men."

 hellas.2020.desc:0 "At dawn on 22 August, several battalions of German infantry (presumably belonging to the 16th regiment of the 22. Luftlande Infanterie-Division) arrived at the Amari valley. They succeeded in surrounding the villages lining the western side of the Amari valley without being noticed by their dwellers. These villages are collectively called the Kedros villages, namely Gerakari, Gourgouthi, Kardaki, Vryses, Smiles, Drygies, Ano Meros, and Chordaki. The nearby village of Krya Vrysi was also surrounded. In all villages, the German raids followed roughly the same pattern. The locals were gathered together, the identities of males were verified, and those to be executed were picked and kept separately. Women were ordered to return to their homes and collect their valuables, on the excuse that they would go on a long journey. This was a ruse to facilitate the looting that would follow. Women, children, and the elderly were taken away, while the men whose lives were spared were forced to march towards Rethymno where they were held in Fortezza for a few weeks. Following their departure, firing squads started the executions in groups. When finished, dead bodies were doused in petrol and set on fire. In some cases, the executions were carried out in a village house which was afterwards dynamited, such as in Gerakari, Vryses, and Ano Meros. In the days following the shootings, village homes were looted and then burned or dynamited, like in Kandanos three years earlier. The looted property was collected at Scholi Asomaton and transported by lorries to Rethymno. Harvests and livestock were confiscated for use by the German troops. Local resistance bands could do nothing but watch, being vastly outnumbered. George Psychoundakis mentions in his book that, from his hideout cave in Ida, he could see smoke rising from the villages for more than a week."

For the entire day, they were interrogated to reveal the whereabouts of the British, but they refused to cooperate despite being tortured and brutally beaten. Near sunset, they were marched outside the village and shot in a nearby canyon. The village was looted."

 hellas.2022.desc:0 "On 2 September, a platoon of ELAS fighters ambushed a government water supply column outside Chortiatis, killing a single driver and gravely injuring his passenger. Half an hour later a second car came under fire on the same location. One German soldier was wounded and taken prisoner along with two Greek workers, whilst the Greek driver and a second soldier managed to flee to Asvestochori. When the denizens of Chortiatis expressed their fears regarding a potential German reprisal towards Antonis Kazakos (the head of the ELAS platoon), he appeared dismissive, exclaiming "This area is part of a free Greece. No German will dare to step his foot into this land", but unbeknownst to him 20 cars loaded with German and Schubert's soldiers were already on their way towards the village. The ELAS band and its captives departed to Livadi, whilst the local men left the village for the surrounding fields even earlier. Upon surrounding the village, the Germans assembled the remaining women and children at the village square, while a second group was taken to the local cafe. When the village mayor Christos Batatsiou attempted to beg the Germans for mercy he was stabbed with a knife by Schubert and taken away by his men, who proceeded to loot and burn 300 houses. The women and children from the square were then forced into the house of Evangelos Davoudis where they were burned alive, only two of them managing to survive. Schubert's men led the second group of civilians into the bakery of Stefanos Gouramanis while one of them played a violin and others sung cheerfully. A machine gun was placed in one of the bakery's windows, gunning down those standing inside. Eight children managed to escape the carnage by climbing out of a small window in the back of the building. Afterwards the collaborationists placed grass on the corpses and set them aflame with a flare gun. Several survivors tried to make an escape but they were stabbed and pushed back by Schubert's men, only one man and one woman absconded through the smoke when they were distracted by the village priest. Five women managed to evade death by claiming that their relatives served in the Security Battalions. Eleven civilians were captured and executed in the vicinity of the village, among them one woman was raped."

After a three-day battle, the ELAS partisans broke through the fortifications and entered the town. The ELAS victory was followed by a massacre, during which prisoners and civilians were executed near a well. The number of executed people is variously estimated at between 700 and 1,100 on different counts. After news of the massacre spread, the leadership of ELAS and of its political parent group, the National Liberation Front (EAM) took steps to ensure a peaceful transition of power in most of the country, limiting reprisal occurrences."
