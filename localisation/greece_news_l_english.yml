 hellenic_news.1.t:0 "The election is over!"
 hellenic_news.1.desc:1 "The elections seemed like a cauldron set on fire. Kómma Filelefthérwn (Liberals) emerged as the largest party in the Parliament, winning 126 out of 300 seats. However, just 20.86% of the legal population came in to vote and even worse, the end result is an equilibrium between the KF (Venizelists) and Laikón Kómma (Anti-Venizelists). The country is facing a deadlock and Demertzis and his cabinet are to stay in power until the two sides come into a consensus."
 hellenic_news.1.a:0 "Wait, so nobody won?"
 hellenic_news.2.t:0 "The King makes his move."
 hellenic_news.2.desc:1 "Seizing the initiative, King George surprises everyone by appointing former general and military genius Ioannis Metaxás as the Minister of War. It is considered a very significant move on behalf of King George, partially because Metaxas is a known royalist, but mostly because he is one of few politicians that support an authoritarian, non-parliamentary regime. "

 hellenic_news.3.t:0 "Demertzis dies of a heart attack. Metaxás becomes Prime Minister"
 hellenic_news.3.desc:0 "\nIn yet another turn of events, Demertzis is reported of having suffered from a sudden heart attack. The King, losing no time whatsoever and without consulting the political leadership, acts and places Metaxás as the country’s Prime Minister."
 hellenic_news.3.a:0 "Rest in peace."
 hellenic_news.4.t:0 "A vote of confidence for the Prime Minister"
 hellenic_news.4.desc:0 "After another failure of the two parties to come into an agreement, Metaxás’ government secured a vote of confidence on April 27th, 1936 with 241 votes for, 4 abstained and 16 against, the members of KKE and Georgios Papandreou. Three days later, the Parliament voted any cease of operations for five months, authorizing the government to act on its own, with the supervision of a parliamentary council, which however is obvious is never going to exist."
 hellenic_news.4.a:0 "The cauldron is still hot, it seems."
 hellenic_news.5.t:0 "Strikes!"
 hellenic_news.5.desc:0 "The patience of the working class seems to have reached its nadir. The harsh working conditions and the reduce in salary has skyrocketed their dissatisfaction and they are now on the streets. The crisis is escalating by the day, if we do not react fast enough, it threatens to go beyond our control."
 hellenic_news.5.a:0 "We must act."
 hellenic_news.5.a_tt:0 "§RIf the necessary focus is not completed within the next few days, the crackdown will be harsher than what the regime had planned and cause a massive upheaval to the political landscape.§!"
 hellenic_news.6.t:0 "Border violations spotted by the Italians"
 hellenic_news.6.desc:0 "The Italians have discovered our fortifications on the Epirus region. Such an act was demt as a casus belli and as such, the Italians have gained the right to invade, if they so much desire."
 hellenic_news.6.a:0 "Damn"
 hellenic_news.6.a_tt:0 "§RThe Italians have gained a wargoal for 30 days. It is unknown whether they will decide to have a go at us or not.§!"
 hellenic_news.7.t:0 "King Zog flees to Greece"
 hellenic_news.7.desc:0 "King Zog of Albania has fled to Greece after his country was taken over by the Italians. Apparently he was very angry, characterizing Hitler and Mussolini as two madmen facing two fools who sleep, referring to Chamberlain and Daladier. Such an outcome could potentially have its own negative effects, but for the time, we should be hospitable to the royal family."
 hellenic_news.7.a:0 "Our hands are getting tied"
 hellenic_news.7.a_tt:0 "§RThe Italians will certainly approach us at some point regarding King Zog. We must be ready to give them a sufficient response.§!"







 ###########################[ EVENTS THAT REQUIRE ACTION ]#########################
 hellas.1.t:0 "The dreadful 9th of May"
 hellas.1.desc:0 "The epicenter of this earthquake is none other than Thessaloniki. The worker’s movement has been demonstrating ferociously on the streets. Metaxás is thinking of a harsh crackdown, that however could lead to deaths. In turn, our regime could be stigmatized domestically and in foreign circles. Perhaps a more unifying approach could work?"
 hellas.1.a:0 "Follow the plan, suppress all troublemakers."
 hellas.1.b:0 "Adopt a milder approach, still make them disperse."
 hellas.1.c:0 "Let's listen to what they have to say..."
 hellas.2.t:0 "The 4th of August Regime is proclaimed!"
 hellas.2.desc:0 "Claiming a state of emergency, the danger of domestic upheaval and the global instability, Metaxas called for a ministerial council and announced his decision to postpone indefinitely many aspects of the Constitution. With the acquiescence, Metaxás dissolved parliament and dictatorship ensued."
 hellas.2.a:0 "Chaire Archige!"
 hellas.3.t:0 "The Influence of the Fascist Standards."
 hellas.3.desc:0 "Although there is an undeniable influence of the strong, firm fascist regimes of Europe, Metaxás is not a proponent of fascism. His realpolitik and realism with which he approaches every situation are more similar to the European mindset. Yet his goal is one of a purely Hellenic path, towards a great future. Not of revanchism, but of civilization. Or so he claims. The future still lies ahead."
 hellas.3.a:0 "Towards a Hellenic Future!"
 hellas.3.b:0 "Realign with the German mindset."
 hellas.4.t:0 "The Cretan Uprising"
 hellas.4.desc:0 "A Coup d'état attempt has taken place on the island of Crete, with the city of Chania as its epicenter. It seems our Asfáleia was unprepared for it and slipped its grasp. Thankfully, due to bad organization the coup collapsed within hours after our timely action. The question now is, how shall we act? Metaxás is considering a tolerant approach"
 hellas.4.a:0 "Follow the plan"
 hellas.4.a_tt:0 "After a month, a series of court martials will take place on Chania, yet through the tolerant attitude of the dictator the main conspirators will flee to Cyprus while the rest will be condemned and exiled. An amnesty will be given after a year. No death penalty will be given. §C\n This action will build relations with Republicans/Communists§!."
 hellas.4.b:0 "Harsh Crackdown"
 hellas.4.b_tt:0 "We will crack down harsh upon the conspirators and inflict them the greatest penalty possible. §C\nThis will further stabilize our regime but inflict a heavy damage on our relations with the Republicans/Communists§!."
 hellas.5.t:0 "The New Archbishop of Athens"
 hellas.5.desc:0 "A new archbishop is to be elected in Athens. The two main contenders are Damaskinos of Corinth and Chrysanthos of Trebizon. The former is a leading opponent of the regime and, although Metaxas has adopted a neutral stance regarding the electoral procedure, he is indeed much closer to Chrysanthos, who is also clearly favored by the King, George II. The voting saw Damaskinos receive 31 votes while Chrysanthos 30, effectively making Damaskinos the elected archbishop of Athens and primate of Greece. But this doesn’t have to be the case. Metaxás has a plan…"
 hellas.5.a:0 "Follow the plan"
 hellas.5.a_tt:0 "This is a blatant anti-Metaxas movement and we have to crush it. We can send Damaskinos to exile In a monastery and forcefully put Chrysanthos on top with a decree. §C\n This action will worsen relations with Republicans§!."
 hellas.5.b:0 "Avoid action"
 hellas.5.b_tt:0 "We should leave the Church to decide for itself. §C\nOur choice to not act upon the election of the archbishop will prove the Republicans/Communists that we can open dialogue§!."
 hellas.6.t:0 "The Communist Threat"
 hellas.6.desc:0 "Our relations with the communists have been extremely poor as of late. Talks of a rebellion have started to appear. To avoid a full out civil war we must act with haste. To ensure that our regime will put an end to the communist threat, we must win the people, as well as organize the security forces."
