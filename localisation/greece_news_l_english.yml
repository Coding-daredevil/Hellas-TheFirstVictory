However, just 20.86% of the legal population came in to vote and even worse, the end result is an equilibrium between the KF (Venizelists) and Laikón Kómma (Anti-Venizelists). The country is facing a deadlock and Demertzis and his cabinet are to stay in power until the two sides come into a consensus."

 hellenic_news.2.desc:1 "Seizing the initiative, King George surprises everyone by appointing former general and military genius Ioannis Metaxás as the Minister of War. It is considered a very significant move on behalf of King George, partially because Metaxas is a known royalist, but mostly because he is one of few politicians that support an authoritarian, non-parliamentary regime.

Three days later, the Parliament voted any cease of operations for five months, authorizing the government to act on its own, with the supervision of a parliamentary council, which however is obvious is never going to exist."

 hellas.1.t:0 "The dreadful 9th of May"
 hellas.1.desc:0 "The epicenter of this earthquake is none other than Thessaloniki. The worker’s movement has been demonstrating ferociously on the streets. Metaxás is thinking of a harsh crackdown, that however could lead to deaths. In turn, our regime could be stigmatized domestically and in foreign circles. Perhaps a more unifying approach could work?"
 hellas.1.a:0 "Follow the plan, suppress all troublemakers."
 hellas.1.b:0 "Adopt a milder approach, still make them disperse."
 hellas.1.c:0 "Let's listen to what they have to say..."
 hellas.2.t:0 "The 4th of August Regime is proclaimed!"
 hellas.2.desc:0 "Claiming a state of emergency, the danger of domestic upheaval and the global instability, Metaxas called for a ministerial council and announced his decision to postpone indefinitely many aspects of the Constitution. With the acquiescence, Metaxás dissolved parliament and dictatorship ensued."
 hellas.2.a:0 "Chaire Archige!"
 hellas.3.t:0 "The Influence of the Fascist Standards."
 hellas.3.desc:0 "Although there is an undeniable influence of the strong, firm fascist regimes of Europe, Metaxás is not a proponent of fascism. His realpolitik and realism with which he approaches every situation are more similar to the European mindset. Yet his goal is one of a purely Hellenic path, towards a great future. Not of revanchism, but of civilization. Or so he claims. The future still lies ahead."
 hellas.3.a:0 "Towards a Hellenic Future!"
 hellas.3.b:0 "Realign with the German mindset."
 hellas.4.t:0 "The Cretan Uprising"
 hellas.4.desc:0 "A Coup d'état attempt has taken place on the island of Crete, with the city of Chania as its epicenter. It seems our Asfáleia was unprepared for it and slipped its grasp. Thankfully, due to bad organization the coup collapsed within hours after our timely action. The question now is, how shall we act? Metaxás is considering a tolerant approach"
 hellas.4.a:0 "Follow the plan"
 hellas.4.a_tt:0 "After a month, a series of court martials will take place on Chania, yet through the tolerant attitude of the dictator the main conspirators will flee to Cyprus while the rest will be condemned and exiled. An amnesty will be given after a year. No death penalty will be given. §C\n This action will build relations with Republicans/Communists§!."
 hellas.4.b:0 "Harsh Crackdown"

 hellas.5.t:0 "The New Archbishop of Athens"
 hellas.5.desc:0 "A new archbishop is to be elected in Athens. The two main contenders are Damaskinos of Corinth and Chrysanthos of Trebizon. The former is a leading opponent of the regime and, although Metaxas has adopted a neutral stance regarding the electoral procedure, he is indeed much closer to Chrysanthos, who is also clearly favored by the King, George II. The voting saw Damaskinos receive 31 votes while Chrysanthos 30, effectively making Damaskinos the elected archbishop of Athens and primate of Greece. But this doesn’t have to be the case. Metaxás has a plan…"
 hellas.5.a:0 "Follow the plan"
 hellas.5.a_tt:0 "This is a blatant anti-Metaxas movement and we have to crush it. We can send Damaskinos to exile In a monastery and forcefully put Chrysanthos on top with a decree. §C\n This action will worsen relations with Republicans§!."
 hellas.5.b:0 "Avoid action"
 hellas.5.b_tt:0 "We should leave the Church to decide for itself. §C\nOur choice to not act upon the election of the archbishop will prove the Republicans/Communists that we can open dialogue§!."

 hellas.301.t:0 "Greco-German Book Collaboration"
 hellas.301.desc:0 "Metaxas’s Minister-Governor of Athens, Kostas Kotzias, contributed to a German publication of the year 1938, entitled Unsterbliches Hellas (Immortal Greece), with an article titled “Die griechische Jugend durch die Jahrhunderte” (The Greek Youth through the Centuries). The book was a high-flying effort. Prefaces to the book were written by Alexander Rizos-Rangavis, Greek ambassador in Berlin, and Alfred Rosenberg, one of the renown intellectuals of the Nazi party and the Kommissar for Supervision of Intellectual and Ideological Education of the NSDAP. Metaxas himself dedicated one of his portraits writing “Für das Buch `Unsterbliches Hellas’."
 hellas.301.a:0 "This is beneficial indeed"
 hellas.302.t:0 "Junges Griechenland"
 hellas.302.desc:0 "Alfred Widenmann, a German film director, screenwriter and author of children's books, has written a book based upon our nation. Young Greece, as it is translated, is attributed to our Youth, EON and consists of a variety of photographic material. It is certainly a great way to advertise ourselves to the average German citizen, as we are presented as the continuators of our great ancestors."
 hellas.302.a:0 "Have we enchanted them?"
 hellas.303.t:0 "Thessaloniki International Exhibition"
 hellas.303.desc:0 "The 11th International Exhibition of Thessaloniki has taken place between the 06-17 of September, 1936. Prime Minister Metaxás gave an important speech, emphasizing that his government will do everything within its power to arm and organize the defence forces of the nation."
 hellas.303.a:0 "Seems we've gotten a reaction"
 hellas.304.t:0 "Inonu's urgent visit to Athens!"
 hellas.304.desc:0 "Secret talks have taken place between the Bulgarians and Yugoslavians. Ismet Inonu has been worried that the matter discussed has something to do with the partioning of Greece and thus has rushed in Athens to talk directly with the Prime Minister. Things are looking urgent."
 hellas.304.a:0 "Support the talks"
 hellas.304.b:0 "Take a few steps back"
 hellas.305.t:0 "Metaxás’ visit to Constantinople"
 hellas.305.desc:0 "One of Metaxás’ main goals has been to solidify the Thracian borders. To that end talks with the Turks have opened, yet we haven't gained much. Lately, Metaxás visited Constantinople to further expand upon this topic, but yet again, nothing of particular value was gained"
 hellas.305.a:0 "Maybe next time"
 hellas.306.t:0 "Metaxás welcomes Turks in Athens"
 hellas.306.desc:0 "Finally, on the 27th of April, 1938, the inviolable of the borders in Evros has been signed between Greece and Turkey, further expanding upon the 1930 and 1933 treaties. This "Additional Greco-Turkish Treaty" as it has been called, also ensures the neutrality of each side in case the opposite is under attack from a third country, while also promising not to become a base of operations for the enemy."

After the funeral, the Prime Minister met Inonu and both agreed into forming a common front inside the Balkan Pact. However, Saracoglu violated the agreement, directly supporting the Bulgarian exit in the Aegean. The Prime Minister writes on his diary:"

 hellas.308.t:0 "Metaxás visits Belgrade upon invitation from Regent"
 hellas.308.desc:0 "At some point, Paul Karageorgevich confided to Metaxás the conspiracy that he had lately uncovered. The Bulgarian Premier, Gheorgi Kioseivanov, had broken the special treaty he had signed with Greece and when he met his counterpart, Milan Stojadinovic, in Nis on Noember 1st, 1938, he proposed the partition of Greece. Thrace would be given to Bulgaria and Thessaloniki to the Yugoslavians. If that wasn't enough already, the Regent also revealed the two-faced policy of the British through ambassador Loraine in Turkey, who sought a Bulgarian exit in the Aegean."
 hellas.308.a:0 "We should immediately reprimand the British"
 hellas.309.t:0 "Formal Protest over the British Transgressions"
 hellas.309.desc:0 "The British have struck a nerve with their actions against us. Our countries have been allies for so many wars, yet their policy of appeasement wants us to suffer an irreversible humiliation just so the Bulgars won't join their German friends on the upcoming conflict. They should realize who their true allies are and fast."
 hellas.309.a:0 "Insist heavily on the protests"
 hellas.3095.t:0 "British recall Loraine and apologize"

 hellas.312.desc:0 "The Romanian Foreign Minister, Grigore Gafencu, has visited Athens. During their meeting, Gafencu noted the following: The only task Metaxás is willing to pursue, is to arm Greece and make her capable to defend herself. "If I was forced", he said, "to oppose the adamant eros that my people have for freedom, I only did so they could keep their national independence. For the times that are about to come, will no longer be beneficial to small nations. Everywhere the "New Order" insults our most beloved ideas. Towards the tendencies of assimilation through force, our fatherlands are under constant threat. It seems that nations have become worthless. Yet, what greater thing can there be in this world but our little homelands?" Reportedly, he pointed his hand at the temple of Athena in Sounio and with a transparent, proudful simplicity said:"

 hellas.313.t:0 "A talk with Emanuele Grazzi"
 hellas.313.desc:0 "During their meeting in 21st of August 1939, Metaxás declared his intentions of Italian ambassador in Greece, Emanuele Grazzi. Grazzi complained for the presence of the Greek army in the Border region after the Italian occupation of Albania. On a serious temper, Metaxás informed Grazzi that things were not as he had mentioned. Greece should be able to defend herself from any attempt over the integrity of her borders and he would act likewise against the British if he had to."

 hellas.315.t:0 "Grazzi's 7th Calling"
 hellas.315.desc:0 "On the 7th of August 1940, Metaxás called Grazzi for the 7th time. All this time he hadn't lost an opportunity to call the Italian ambassador and clear things out, making sure that the Italians won't get the ruse they so much hope for. This time however, he called Grazzi to complain for the non-friendly stance of Italy in the case of the Greek consul, Skárpas, in Geneva. Grazzi attempted to go on the counterattack, blaiming the Greek side for allowing british ships to use the Greek flag. Through an array of arguments Metaxás shut Grazzi down. Grazzi left ensuring Metaxás that Mussolini and Ciano had an absolute friendly dispotition towards the Greek state. Yet, on the 11th of August, the Premier notes on his diary:"

Goebbels is said to have writen in his diary that he considers his days in Greece to be among the happiest in his life and that he was enchanted by his encounter with the remnants of the ancient Greek civilization. It is worth noting that Goebbels insisted on visiting Sparta, which is of important symbolic value both to Metaxas and the Nazis"

 hellas.101.desc:0 "Loyal to their words (possibly having learned their lesson from Poland), the British are offering us a membership into the allies. However, such an offer is a double-edged sword. If Greece accepts the invitation, the Germans are certain to intervene in favor of the Italians. There is also much doubt on the quantity of the Allied assistance as the transfer of divisions from Egypt will be limited. The British indeed offered a lot less divisions than what the Prime Minister had asked for. On the other hand, pursuing the war alone (at least on papers) and achieving key victories, could potentially open a diplomatic route to end hostilities."
