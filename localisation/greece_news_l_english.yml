However, just 20.86% of the legal population came in to vote and even worse, the end result is an equilibrium between the KF (Venizelists) and Laikón Kómma (Anti-Venizelists). The country is facing a deadlock and Demertzis and his cabinet are to stay in power until the two sides come into a consensus."
