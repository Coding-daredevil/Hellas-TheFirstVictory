However, just 20.86% of the legal population came in to vote and even worse, the end result is an equilibrium between the KF (Venizelists) and Laikón Kómma (Anti-Venizelists). The country is facing a deadlock and Demertzis and his cabinet are to stay in power until the two sides come into a consensus."

It is considered a very significant move on behalf of King George, partially because Metaxas is a known royalist, but mostly because he is one of few politicians that support an authoritarian, non-parliamentary regime.

 hellas.1.t:0 "The dreadful 9th of May"
 hellas.1.desc:0 "The epicenter of this earthquake is none other than Thessaloniki. The worker’s movement has been demonstrating ferociously on the streets. Metaxás is thinking of a harsh crackdown, that however could lead to deaths. In turn, our regime could be stigmatized domestically and in foreign circles. Perhaps a more unifying approach could work?"
 hellas.1.a:0 "Follow the plan, suppress all troublemakers."
 hellas.1.b:0 "Adopt a milder approach, still make them disperse."
 hellas.1.c:0 "Let's listen to what they have to say..."
 hellas.2.t:0 "The 4th of August Regime is proclaimed!"
 hellas.2.desc:0 "Claiming a state of emergency, the danger of domestic upheaval and the global instability, Metaxas called for a ministerial council and announced his decision to postpone indefinitely many aspects of the Constitution. With the acquiescence, Metaxás dissolved parliament and dictatorship ensued."
 hellas.2.a:0 "Chaire Archige!"
 hellas.3.t:0 "The Influence of the Fascist Standards."
 hellas.3.desc:0 "Although there is an undeniable influence of the strong, firm fascist regimes of Europe, Metaxás is not a proponent of fascism. His realpolitik and realism with which he approaches every situation are more similar to the European mindset. Yet his goal is one of a purely Hellenic path, towards a great future. Not of revanchism, but of civilization. Or so he claims. The future still lies ahead."
 hellas.3.a:0 "Towards a Hellenic Future!"
 hellas.3.b:0 "Realign with the German mindset."

 hellas.4.desc:0 "A Coup d'état attempt has taken place on the island of Crete, with the city of Chania as its epicenter. It seems our Asfáleia was unprepared for it and slipped its grasp. Thankfully, due to bad organization the coup collapsed within hours after our timely action. The question now is, how shall we act? Metaxás is considering a tolerant approach"
 hellas.4.a:0 "Follow the plan"
 hellas.4.a_tt:0 "After a month, a series of court martials will take place on Chania, yet through the tolerant attitude of the dictator the main conspirators will flee to Cyprus while the rest will be condemned and exiled.

 hellas.5.desc:0 "A new archbishop is to be elected in Athens. The two main contenders are Damaskinos of Corinth and Chrysanthos of Trebizon. The former is a leading opponent of the regime and, although Metaxas has adopted a neutral stance regarding the electoral procedure, he is indeed much closer to Chrysanthos, who is also clearly favored by the King, George II. The voting saw Damaskinos receive 31 votes while Chrysanthos 30, effectively making Damaskinos the elected archbishop of Athens and primate of Greece. But this doesn’t have to be the case. Metaxás has a plan…"
 hellas.5.a:0 "Follow the plan"
 hellas.5.a_tt:0 "This is a blatant anti-Metaxas movement and we have to crush it. We can send Damaskinos to exile In a monastery and forcefully put Chrysanthos on top with a decree. §C\n This action will worsen relations with Republicans§!."

The book was a high-flying effort. Prefaces to the book were written by Alexander Rizos-Rangavis, Greek ambassador in Berlin, and Alfred Rosenberg, one of the renown intellectuals of the Nazi party and the Kommissar for Supervision of Intellectual and Ideological Education of the NSDAP. Metaxas himself dedicated one of his portraits writing “Für das Buch `Unsterbliches Hellas’."

 hellas.302.desc:0 "Alfred Widenmann, a German film director, screenwriter and author of children's books, has written a book based upon our nation. Young Greece, as it is translated, is attributed to our Youth, EON and consists of a variety of photographic material. It is certainly a great way to advertise ourselves to the average German citizen, as we are presented as the continuators of our great ancestors."

 hellas.303.desc:0 "The 11th International Exhibition of Thessaloniki has taken place between the 06-17 of September, 1936. Prime Minister Metaxás gave an important speech, emphasizing that his government will do everything within its power to arm and organize the defence forces of the nation."
 hellas.303.a:0 "Seems we've gotten a reaction"
 hellas.304.t:0 "Inonu's urgent visit to Athens!"
 hellas.304.desc:0 "Secret talks have taken place between the Bulgarians and Yugoslavians. Ismet Inonu has been worried that the matter discussed has something to do with the partioning of Greece and thus has rushed in Athens to talk directly with the Prime Minister. Things are looking urgent."

 hellas.305.desc:0 "One of Metaxás’ main goals has been to solidify the Thracian borders. To that end talks with the Turks have opened, yet we haven't gained much. Lately, Metaxás visited Constantinople to further expand upon this topic, but yet again, nothing of particular value was gained"

 hellas.306.desc:0 "Finally, on the 27th of April, 1938, the inviolable of the borders in Evros has been signed between Greece and Turkey, further expanding upon the 1930 and 1933 treaties.

After the funeral, the Prime Minister met Inonu and both agreed into forming a common front inside the Balkan Pact. However, Saracoglu violated the agreement, directly supporting the Bulgarian exit in the Aegean. The Prime Minister writes on his diary:"

 hellas.308.t:0 "Metaxás visits Belgrade upon invitation from Regent"
 hellas.308.desc:0 "At some point, Paul Karageorgevich confided to Metaxás the conspiracy that he had lately uncovered. The Bulgarian Premier, Gheorgi Kioseivanov, had broken the special treaty he had signed with Greece and when he met his counterpart, Milan Stojadinovic, in Nis on Noember 1st, 1938, he proposed the partition of Greece. Thrace would be given to Bulgaria and Thessaloniki to the Yugoslavians. If that wasn't enough already, the Regent also revealed the two-faced policy of the British through ambassador Loraine in Turkey, who sought a Bulgarian exit in the Aegean."
 hellas.308.a:0 "We should immediately reprimand the British"
 hellas.309.t:0 "Formal Protest over the British Transgressions"
 hellas.309.desc:0 "The British have struck a nerve with their actions against us. Our countries have been allies for so many wars, yet their policy of appeasement wants us to suffer an irreversible humiliation just so the Bulgars won't join their German friends on the upcoming conflict. They should realize who their true allies are and fast."

 hellas.312.desc:0 "The Romanian Foreign Minister, Grigore Gafencu, has visited Athens. During their meeting, Gafencu noted the following: The only task Metaxás is willing to pursue, is to arm Greece and make her capable to defend herself. "If I was forced", he said, "to oppose the adamant eros that my people have for freedom, I only did so they could keep their national independence. For the times that are about to come, will no longer be beneficial to small nations. Everywhere the "New Order" insults our most beloved ideas. Towards the tendencies of assimilation through force, our fatherlands are under constant threat. It seems that nations have become worthless. Yet, what greater thing can there be in this world but our little homelands?" Reportedly, he pointed his hand at the temple of Athena in Sounio and with a transparent, proudful simplicity said:"

Grazzi complained for the presence of the Greek army in the Border region after the Italian occupation of Albania. On a serious temper, Metaxás informed Grazzi that things were not as he had mentioned. Greece should be able to defend herself from any attempt over the integrity of her borders and he would act likewise against the British if he had to."

All this time he hadn't lost an opportunity to call the Italian ambassador and clear things out, making sure that the Italians won't get the ruse they so much hope for. This time however, he called Grazzi to complain for the non-friendly stance of Italy in the case of the Greek consul, Skárpas, in Geneva. Grazzi attempted to go on the counterattack, blaiming the Greek side for allowing british ships to use the Greek flag. Through an array of arguments Metaxás shut Grazzi down. Grazzi left ensuring Metaxás that Mussolini and Ciano had an absolute friendly dispotition towards the Greek state. Yet, on the 11th of August, the Premier notes on his diary:"

 hellas.317.desc:0 "For a while, the plot has been under close observation of the almighty security guard of the regime, Maniadakis, who informed Metaxas almost daily about the activities and discussions of those involved in the conspiracy. Metaxas took the threat seriously and attentively followed the events. The plot finally materialized on June 3rd 1940. With a tough move with the help of Maniadakis’ well-oiled machinery, Metaxas swept all the conspirators within a few hours. Platys was arrested, was subjected to constant interrogations and eventually banished, while all the other conspirators were arrested and put behind bars or into exile. Kontoumas was forced to leave Greece in order not to be arrested and avoid a diplomatic incident, while Metaxas closed the offices of a German-speaking newspaper in Athens, where talks on the conspiracy had been held. Even some pro-Axis members of the EON were ousted. The most alarming thing for Metaxas however was that the whole plot was known to his closest associate Kostas Kotzias, who seemed to be entertaining the idea of succeeding him and lead Greece into the Axis side. However, after the events Kotzias presented himself to Metaxas and assured him of his total loyalty to him, but the Cephalonite only accepted his pledges bitterly, as his trust on his old close associate had now cracked."

Goebbels is said to have writen in his diary that he considers his days in Greece to be among the happiest in his life and that he was enchanted by his encounter with the remnants of the ancient Greek civilization. It is worth noting that Goebbels insisted on visiting Sparta, which is of important symbolic value both to Metaxas and the Nazis"

If Greece accepts the invitation, the Germans are certain to intervene in favor of the Italians. There is also much doubt on the quantity of the Allied assistance as the transfer of divisions from Egypt will be limited.

 hellas.996.desc:0 "On 05:30 hours, on the morning of the [?GRE.date_of_directive_date.GetDateStringNoHourLong], the German ambassador in Greece, prince Viktor zu Erbach-Schönberg, gave premier Koryzis an ultimatum that justified the reasons behind the German attack. The government of the Reich issued the command to attack to hunt down and remove all British Armed Forces from Greek land. Any resistance will be crushed without discretion. Alexandros Koryzis replied that Greece will resist and won't submit without a fight. The German troops had already begun attacking at 05:15, breaking the treaty of Hague, thus making this war a "surprise" one."

 hellas.997.desc:0 "On the [?GRE.piraeus_boming_date.GetDateStringNoHourLong], German bombers air raided the city-port of Piraeus. The attack itself did not cause great destruction, but the fires and detonations that followed were catastrophic. During the bombardment, a ship carrying TNT was hit, causing a huge explosion, destroying seven out of the twelve piers of the harbor."

 hellas.998.desc:0 "On the [?GRE.thess_capture_date.GetDateStringNoHourLong], the 2nd Panzer division captured the key-city of Thessaloniki, after breaking through the weakest part of the Metaxás Line, taking advantage of the Yugoslav collapse. As the main Greek army (Epirus Army - Stratiá Hpeírou) was still confronting the Italians on Albania, the thinnly spread garrisons were not a match for the German Force. Interestingly enough, the invasion of Greece was the first operation were mechanized infantry and tank divisions were used on mountainous terrain. The tactic of using such divisions as a spearhead proved sound, as it was the main reason Thessaloniki was captured so fast."

 hellas.999.t:0 "Koryzis commits suicide!"
 hellas.999.desc:0 "Found with two bullets to his heart, it was deemed that the primer minister had commited suicide after a disasterous private meeting with the King. It will never be known what was said on this meeting, but it is thought that the two men disagreed over the evacuation of the Greek government to Crete or Cyprus. The King himself said there was a dispute, albeit a mild one. It is said that Koryzis left the meeting devastated, picking his coat after suddenly kissing his hands and headed to his house in Vasilissis Sofias avenue. Worrying for him, the King sent his hair Paulos after him (another report speaks of Diakos). While speaking with Koryzis' wife in the entrance, two gunshots were heard from the first floor. The circumstances around the death of the prime minister, have lead to the dispute of his suicide. Being a right-handed man, it was very peculiar that he used his left hand to shoot himself twice, which alone is a very, very rare event. In addition, there hasn't been an official autopsy for the causes of his death, while the Orthodox church that by dogma denies burial rights for people who suicided, agreed to bury Koryzis in normal fashion. Some say Koryzis couldn't stand the pressure. Some that he was accused of treason, as there was a leak and both the King and the British accused him of it. Another rumor has it that Koryzis fell in love with a woman that was proven to be a German spy and humilitation armed his hand. It is thought that the British had a hand in this, through the British ambassador who disliked Koryzis from the start."

 hellas.9995.t:0 "Emmanouil Tsouderos is sworn Prime Minister!"
 hellas.9995.desc:0 "Following the suicide of Prime Minister Alexandros Koryzis 3 days ago, amidst the German invasion of Greece, King George II of Greece sought for his successor. Several names, such as Konstantinos Kotzias, the former dictator General Theodoros Pangalos, and the Venizelist general Alexandros Mazarakis-Ainian were discussed, but either rejected or turned down the offer. As the evacuation of the Greek government to Crete was being prepared, Tsouderos, as a Venizelist and Cretan, as well as a known Anglophile, emerged as a prominent choice for the post during the 20th. On the next day, after attending a séance in which the spirit of Venizelos urged him to accept, Tsouderos accepted and was sworn in as Prime Minister."

 hellas.1000.t:0 "The Capitulation of the Mainland"
 hellas.1000.desc:0 "As the Axis forces have penetrated our lines, any future resistance is deemed futile and a tragic loss of life, as the Germans have encircled our soldiers. General Tsolakoglou has decided to surrender the army of Epirus (Stratiá Hpeírou), but not without achieving a last blow to the enemy. He rushed to sign a cease-to-all hostilities pact with LSSAH-commander Sepp Dietrich. Tsolakoglou was so determined to deny the Italians the satisfaction of a victory they never won, that he begun talks without having an order to do so. The surrender was to be made only to the Germans. Hitler personally agreed and attempted not to include the Italians. A truce would be called for 10 days, where the Greek army would be allowed to leave Albania without the Italians pursuing them. After disarming them, all soldiers would be allowed to return home as non-prisoners, while the officers would keep their arms in honor. Sadly, the Germans did not keep their promises. During the signature, they were ruthlessly bombing Ioannina. A second treaty was signed when General von List learned about the treaty, with much worse conditions this time. Tsolakoglou signed as a prisoner with no free will, surrending however the army only to the Germans. Mussolini was so irritated by this that he ordered immediate attacks on the Greek forces, but they were repelled. Only when he himself reached out to Hitler, was a truce achieved with Italy as a member. The final treaty was signed on [?GRE.treaty_signed_date.GetDateStringNoHour]. The soldiers would become prisoners of war. For their valor in combat, the officers would be allowed to keep their arms. All would be amassed to concentration camps and would subsequently be released after all fighting had stopped. In reality however, things were a bit hectic. Upon learning the news, some troops just dropped their arms and went home the quickest way the could find, but some resisted. Konstantinos Versis gave order to destroy all artillery and commited suicide, as his soldiers chanted the national anthem."

 hellas.1001.t:0 "The sacrifice of the Evzon"
 hellas.1001.desc:0 "It is said that Konstantinos Koukkidis was a 17-year old Evzon that had guard duty in the Acropolis of Athens, the day the Germans entered the city. Some other sources say he was a member of E.O.N. The Nazi troops ordered him to take down the Greek Flag and raise the German Nazi war flag in its place. Loyal to his duty, Koukkidis lowered the flag, wrapped himself with it and jumped to his death from the Acropolis."
 hellas.1001.a:0 "Loyal to his oath"
 hellas.1002.t:0 "Swastika over the Acropolis"
 hellas.1002.desc:0 "What is certain however (and quite comical), was the dispute for the entry of troops in the city. Hitler wanted no parade to take place, so he wouldn't hurt the Greek national pride. Mussolini on the other hand insisted on a fancy entrance for the Italian troops. The Fuhrer eventually submitted to the Italian demand and the German and Italian troops paraded together in an empty city, as the population had already defied the conqueror from not appearing. Wilhelm Keitel notes: "This disgraceful spectacle, that was prepared from our brave ally that they had honorably defeated, must have created a faint smile to the Greeks"."
 hellas.1002.a:0 "Heads held up high"
 hellas.1003.t:0 "The Hellenic State"
 hellas.1003.desc:0 "Opposing the Italians again, the Germans decided to set up a collaboration government to take over the mundane aspects of everyday life. Interestingly enough, this is the first time it ever happens, as till now every capitulated nation was governed directly by a German, who now takes the all-too-powerful position of advisor to the government, having absolute powers and veto with his Italian counterpart. Even in France, there was a german commisioned to govern the capital, while the Vichy government took over the south. Some say it was an act of respect towards the Greeks, some say it was just more practical. The man of the hour seems to be Georgios Tsolakoglou, a general no more. His first act, as a former republican, was to outlaw the King immediately."
