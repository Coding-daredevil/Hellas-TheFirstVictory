GRE_escalating_strikes:0 "Dealing with the Strikes"
GRE_escalating_strikes_desc:0 "The escalating crisis with the strikes centered around Thessaloniki must be dealt with fast. Metaxás is a known anti-proponent of the communist ideology and this is a good chance to make an enemy out it and stabilize the nation.

GRE_domestic_policy_desc:0 "Our kathestos is formally a duumvirate, yet the rains should only be in Metaxás' hands. Establishing parallel ministries, we can replace the royalists with our own loyal people. These sub-ministries will hold more power than other ordinary ministries, and from their deliberately humble denomination, one will not be able to deduct that they are in fact the pillars of the regime."

GRE_foreign_policy_desc:0 "By proclaiming himself as the foreign policy minister, Metaxás will be able to control the country's foreign relations, even further isolating the King.

GRE_public_works_desc:0 "Contrary to the popular belief that Metaxás’ regime was primarily one of militarism and military ideals, like the rest of dictatorships across Europe, the truth was that such ideals were so apparent only because of the harsh circumstances Greece found herself into. In reality, Metaxás would not follow other dictators into wearing his uniform but instead opted for his suit (and his cane)."

The state of the military is one of complete abandonmnet, having only received indifference from any past government since 1923, due to the unstable political climate. A conscription of 14 Merarchíes (divisions) Pezikoú (infantry), 1 Ippikoú (cavalry) and 4 Taxiarcíes Pezikoú (Brigades) are to be expected, but currently there is not enough equipment for more than six. The Airforce essentially exists only in papers, with 5 pursuit fighters and 41 anti air guns, while half of the current 12.000 machine guns are completely useless.

Another old acquittance of Metaxas involved was Theodoros Tourkovassilis, a pro-German fanatic who had been one of the co-founders of the Freethinkers party nearly twenty years ago. Other members of the conspiracy were anti-Venizelist politicians such as Stephanos Stephanopoulos, Dimitris Polyzos, Petros Rallis, Pericles Rallis and Sotirios Gotzamanis. The main supporter in the Army was Lieutenant-General Constantine Platys. Seemingly the plot was secretly funded by the Germans, who wanted Greece on their side, through Egon Kontoumas, a Greek-German businessman and chemical engineer with Nazi leanings. He acted as liaison between the pro-Axis Greeks and their Nazi patrons in Germany. The time to take some action has come. The ringleaders and their accomplishes have all been identified.

During the Balkan Wars he served his military service. He had been a collaborator of Metaxas in the Freethinkers Party, but later switched to the Liberals, which earned him the epithet of an ‘adventurist’. In 1934 he was elected Mayor of Athens. Kotzias has been a fan of Benito Mussolini’s fascism. In addition, Kotzias is an overt supporter of Hitlerism in Greece, and had attempted to found a youth movement on Hitler’s model in Greece before. As one of the main supporters of Nazism in Greece, he established powerful contacts with the German regime. In fact, Kotzias had a friendly relationship with both Goering and Goebbels and he is one of the few Greeks to have met Hitler personally. He is known in Berlin to be the “perfect advertiser” of the Nazi ideology in Greece. The British viewed him as the Greek Goering, and Goebbels described him as a true friend of the German people."

Born to an ethnic Greek family in the region of Bor, Cappadocia, Asia Minor in 1890, Prodromos migrated to Greece after the Greco-Turkish War (1919–22). A very smart brain, since 1934 he controlls Pyrkal, one of the oldest Greek defence industries. Bodosakis and Metaxas were introduced in early 1934 by Emmanouel Tsouderos, then Governor of the Bank of Greece. The two met at the offices of the Greek telephone company and discussed the possibility of Bodosakis employing Metaxas’ son-in-law, Georgios Mantzoufas.

In 1924, she came to Greece, where she adopted a naive nationalist and conservative approach to her work. Her style coincides with the Greek state’s need to produce an ideal view of the country and its people, for internal as well as external purposes (mainly tourism). In this respect, Nelly can be seen as the first Greek “national” advertiser. She is usually referred to as Nelly’s (nobody knows why, perhaps to replicate the Byzantine icon-painters who signed with their name in the genitive case to indicate that the ‘writing’ of the icon was by their own hand).

She was in Germany when Adolf Hitler was struggling to achieve power, and there she embraced National Socialist ideas. When the Nazis finally came to power on January 30, 1933, she was appointed executive at the Ministry of Propaganda. Joseph Goebbels appreciated the education and qualifications of a “young Greek woman,” as she called her, and Alfred Rosenberg frequently mentioned the training of a “Greek collaborator” in the Enlightenment department. According to reports, Sitsa Karaiskaki was also chosen by the Abwehr chief (and a descendant of the Greek Kanaris family) Wilhelm Von Canaris to become an associate of the German secret intelligence service in the field of propaganda. In 1933, together with the lawyer Evangelos Kyriakis and the author Kyriakos Karamanos, she founded the publishing house “Nea Genea”. An important book published by the editorial was the political diary of Joseph Goebbels titled “From the Kaiserhof to the Reich Chancellery”. Other published books were “Jews and Communism” by Hermann Fest in 1934, “Mental and spiritual poison – The essence and spirit of Bolshevism” or “The war against religion and the Church”. Also in 1934, Karaïskaki, who wrote both in Greek and German, wrote and published her book “Das dritte Reich durch meine Brille” (“The Third Reich through my glasses”), referring to the events of her contemporary time and “the achievements of the National Socialist government”."

His relationship with Metaxas began many years before August 4, 1936 – they were acquaintances from the days of the failed counter-revolutionary movement of 1923. Their relations were restored during the dictatorship, when Metaxas appointed Diakos as a minister without portfolio. From that position Diakos became a successful power broker, a political fixer and a influential adviser for Metaxas. His role raised suspicions among many. The English ambassador to Athens considered him “a sinister and shadowy figure”. In the same vein, the Foreign Office described him as “the ’eminence grise’ of the dictatorship, [who attended] all cabinet meetings, and [controlled] large industrial and financial interests” and described him as “…an able, unscrupulous and aggressive schemer”, while the historian PJ Vatikiotis regarded him as “a strange and mysterious figure, highly influential in the government of Metaxas as the major rival of the other strong personality in that government, Kostas Kotzias”. Besides being one of Metaxas’ closest associates, Diakos was also the chief go-between the dictator and the financial and business circles, and the closest link between Metaxas and the arms sales."

With the rank of Lieutenant General, he led the Western Macedonia Army Section in the Greco-Italian War. After the German invasion and capture of Thessaloniki, the withdrawal of WMAS from Northern Epirus was belatedly ordered. The German motorized units, however, succeeded in reaching the vital Metsovon Pass, overcame local Greek resistance and captured Ioannina on the following day, thereby effectively cutting off the Hellenic Army."

The National Greek War Relief Association, an organization formed in October 1940 by the Greek Orthodox Church, started to raise funds in the United States and to organize relief efforts to supply the population with food and medicine. The Allied high command are kinda reluctant to lift the blockade since it is the only form of pressure they have on the Axis Powers. However, a compromise can be reached to allow shipments of grain to come from the neutral Turkey, despite the fact that it was within the blockade zone. Turkish president İsmet İnönü is willing to sign a decision to help the people whose army he had personally fought during the Turkish War of Independence 19 years prior. The people of Turkey thus will become the first to lend a helping hand to Greece. Foodstuffs will be collected by a nationwide campaign of Kızılay (Turkish Red Crescent) and the operation will be mainly funded by the American Greek War Relief Association and the Hellenic Union of Constantinopolitans. Food supplies were sent to the port of Istanbul to be shipped to Greece. SS Kurtuluş is to be prepared for her voyage with big symbols of the Red Crescent painted on both sides. After having receiving permission from London to cross the blockade zone, the ship will leave Karaköy Pier on 6 October 1941 for the first time. Upon landing in Piraeus, the port city near Athens, the International Red Cross will take charge of unloading and of distributing the foodstuffs. In the following months, SS Kurtuluş is to make three more voyages to Greece delivering a total of 6,735 tons of food aid."

In 1877 he enrolled at the School of Law, Economics and Political Sciences of the University of Athens, but he soon abandoned his studies. In 1880s, he worked as a journalist. He published his first collection of verses, the "Songs of My Fatherland", in 1886. He held an administrative post at the University of Athens between 1897 and 1926. Palamas wrote the lyrics to the Olympic Hymn, composed by Spyridon Samaras. It was first performed at the 1896 Summer Olympics, the first modern Olympic Games. The Hymn was then shelved as each host city from then until the 1960 Winter Olympics commissioned an original piece for its celebration of the Games.\n\nHe has been informally called the "national" poet of Greece and was closely associated with the struggle to rid Modern Greece of the "purist" language and with political liberalism. He dominated literary life for 30 or more years and greatly influenced the entire political-intellectual climate of his time. Romain Rolland considered him the greatest poet of Europe and he was nominated for the Nobel Prize for Literature on a total of 14 occasions, but never received it."
