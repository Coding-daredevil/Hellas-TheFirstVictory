Metaxás is thinking of a harsh crackdown of the troublemakers while mostly giving into the demands of the tobacco-workers.

The voting saw Damaskinos receive 31 votes while Chrysanthos 30, effectively making Damaskinos the elected archbishop of Athens and primate of Greece. The ceremony of the 'Grand Message' has already taken place and his enthronement is soon to follow suit. However, Ioánnis Metaxás and the regime put in action a plan to oppose all this, as they consider Damaskinós a Venizelist and as such undesirable to take control of the church.\n\nThe Prime Minister objected to Damaskínos' election and forced its the cancellation through a group of priests led by the metropolitan priest of Fthiótida, Amvrósios. The claim was that in the voters there was a metropolitan priest who had been convicted and had lost his axiom, but in reality, his appeal had already been accepted and as such was eligible to participate.\n\nThe Council of State accepted the objection (8-7 in favor) but there has been a wave of objections by 32 metropolitan priests. The regime has already drafted a special law for the occasion, which will bypass everyone and put Chrysanthus in power, however, there is always the option of accepting Damaskinós."

It failed to establish itself in Athens and most of mainland Greece. The government quickly reacted, and loyal forces under the leadership of General Georgios Kondylis put the revolt down by March 11, when Venizelos himself was forced to flee Greece. In the coup's aftermath, a military tribunal was set up to purge the Armed Forces of Venizelist and Republican officers, by ordering the execution of two prominent Venizelist generals, Anastasios Papoulas and Miltiadis Koimisis, as well as major Stamatis Volanis on April 24. Venizelos, Plastiras and prominent followers likewise were condemned to death in absentia.\n\nThe failure of the revolt marked the triumph of anti-Venizelist forces and quickened the collapse of the fragile Second Hellenic Republic. The final death blow was given last October, when the Armed Forces overthrew the government in a coup and Kondylis declared himself regent for the restored monarchy.\n\nSurprisingly, Plastíras seems to be in favor of a dictatorship led by Metaxás, as long as the exiled generals are restored to their former ranks. Such an act however is very likely to cause chaos in the army and even be the starting point of a new civil war.\n\nMetaxás considers this asbolutely impossible for these reasons, but in an effort to bury the hatchet, he is thinking of reverting the death penalties and even allowing very few, non-prominent figures to return to their former ranks."

Metaxas took the threat seriously and attentively followed the events. The plot finally materialized on June 3rd 1940. With a tough move with the help of Maniadakis’ well-oiled machinery, Metaxas swept all the conspirators within a few hours. Platys was arrested, was subjected to constant interrogations and eventually banished, while all the other conspirators were arrested and put behind bars or into exile. Kontoumas was forced to leave Greece in order not to be arrested and avoid a diplomatic incident, while Metaxas closed the offices of a German-speaking newspaper in Athens, where talks on the conspiracy had been held. Even some pro-Axis members of the EON were ousted. The most alarming thing for Metaxas however was that the whole plot was known to his closest associate Kostas Kotzias, who seemed to be entertaining the idea of succeeding him and lead Greece into the Axis side. However, after the events Kotzias presented himself to Metaxas and assured him of his total loyalty to him, but the Cephalonite only accepted his pledges bitterly, as his trust on his old close associate had now cracked."

In response, the commander of the German division, General Karl von Le Suire personally ordered the "severest measures" — the killing of the male population of Kalavryta — on 10 December 1943. Operation Kalavryta was mounted from six cities: Patras, Aigion, and Corinth on the Gulf of Corinth and from Argos, Pyrgos and Tripolis in central Peloponnese. Wehrmacht troops burnt villages and monasteries and shot civilians on their way. The Germans reached Kalavryta on December 9. In the early morning of December 13, 1943 the Germans rounded up all residents of the town and forced them into the school building where they separated the older boys and men from the women and children. They moved the men to a field owned by Thanasis Kappis, a school teacher, just overlooking the town. After looting the town and setting it ablaze, the Germans machine-gunned the men. 438 men and older boys were killed. There were only 13 male survivors, saved because they were hidden under the bodies of the dead. Austrian soldiers were part of the contingent. The next call of order was to lock rounded up women and children into a primary school. After doing so the Germans set the school on fire. There was one Austrian man who disobeyed orders & opened doors to the blazing school, knowing he would sacrifice his life, for women and children to escape. He was later executed for his acts of treason, but the victims escaped. The following day the Nazi troops burned down the Agia Lavra monastery, a landmark of the Greek War of Independence. In total, 693 civilians were killed during the reprisals of Operation Kalavryta. Twenty-eight communities—towns, villages, monasteries and settlements—were destroyed.

The attack and resulting massacre was seen as retaliation by the Nazi German troops against alleged resistance activity in the village, and that it had supported a deadly attack on a German officer in the nearby area of Zita."

 hellas.2020.desc:0 "At dawn on 22 August, several battalions of German infantry (presumably belonging to the 16th regiment of the 22. Luftlande Infanterie-Division) arrived at the Amari valley. They succeeded in surrounding the villages lining the western side of the Amari valley without being noticed by their dwellers. These villages are collectively called the Kedros villages, namely Gerakari, Gourgouthi, Kardaki, Vryses, Smiles, Drygies, Ano Meros, and Chordaki. The nearby village of Krya Vrysi was also surrounded. In all villages, the German raids followed roughly the same pattern. The locals were gathered together, the identities of males were verified, and those to be executed were picked and kept separately. Women were ordered to return to their homes and collect their valuables, on the excuse that they would go on a long journey. This was a ruse to facilitate the looting that would follow. Women, children, and the elderly were taken away, while the men whose lives were spared were forced to march towards Rethymno where they were held in Fortezza for a few weeks. Following their departure, firing squads started the executions in groups. When finished, dead bodies were doused in petrol and set on fire. In some cases, the executions were carried out in a village house which was afterwards dynamited, such as in Gerakari, Vryses, and Ano Meros. In the days following the shootings, village homes were looted and then burned or dynamited, like in Kandanos three years earlier. The looted property was collected at Scholi Asomaton and transported by lorries to Rethymno. Harvests and livestock were confiscated for use by the German troops. Local resistance bands could do nothing but watch, being vastly outnumbered. George Psychoundakis mentions in his book that, from his hideout cave in Ida, he could see smoke rising from the villages for more than a week."

For the entire day, they were interrogated to reveal the whereabouts of the British, but they refused to cooperate despite being tortured and brutally beaten. Near sunset, they were marched outside the village and shot in a nearby canyon. The village was looted."

 hellas.2022.desc:0 "On 2 September, a platoon of ELAS fighters ambushed a government water supply column outside Chortiatis, killing a single driver and gravely injuring his passenger. Half an hour later a second car came under fire on the same location. One German soldier was wounded and taken prisoner along with two Greek workers, whilst the Greek driver and a second soldier managed to flee to Asvestochori. When the denizens of Chortiatis expressed their fears regarding a potential German reprisal towards Antonis Kazakos (the head of the ELAS platoon), he appeared dismissive, exclaiming "This area is part of a free Greece. No German will dare to step his foot into this land", but unbeknownst to him 20 cars loaded with German and Schubert's soldiers were already on their way towards the village. The ELAS band and its captives departed to Livadi, whilst the local men left the village for the surrounding fields even earlier. Upon surrounding the village, the Germans assembled the remaining women and children at the village square, while a second group was taken to the local cafe. When the village mayor Christos Batatsiou attempted to beg the Germans for mercy he was stabbed with a knife by Schubert and taken away by his men, who proceeded to loot and burn 300 houses. The women and children from the square were then forced into the house of Evangelos Davoudis where they were burned alive, only two of them managing to survive. Schubert's men led the second group of civilians into the bakery of Stefanos Gouramanis while one of them played a violin and others sung cheerfully. A machine gun was placed in one of the bakery's windows, gunning down those standing inside. Eight children managed to escape the carnage by climbing out of a small window in the back of the building. Afterwards the collaborationists placed grass on the corpses and set them aflame with a flare gun. Several survivors tried to make an escape but they were stabbed and pushed back by Schubert's men, only one man and one woman absconded through the smoke when they were distracted by the village priest. Five women managed to evade death by claiming that their relatives served in the Security Battalions. Eleven civilians were captured and executed in the vicinity of the village, among them one woman was raped."

After a three-day battle, the ELAS partisans broke through the fortifications and entered the town. The ELAS victory was followed by a massacre, during which prisoners and civilians were executed near a well. The number of executed people is variously estimated at between 700 and 1,100 on different counts. After news of the massacre spread, the leadership of ELAS and of its political parent group, the National Liberation Front (EAM) took steps to ensure a peaceful transition of power in most of the country, limiting reprisal occurrences."
