Some decisions can only be taken once and at a cost. Every time a proposal is finalized some days are required in order for it to be evaluated by the Axis. If the proposal fails, a new cycle of negotiations will begin.

 event_info_loc_h241_b:0 "§LThe negotiation between you and the opposing party are centered around two points. The §YState Worth§! and the §YRecipient Willingness§!.\n * §YState Worth§! defines the magnitude of benefits (derived by §7resources§!).\n * §YRecipient Willingness§! is how much they want these resources.\n     (e.g.) Certain countries like §5Germany§! desire §4Fuel§!.\n\n§YRecipient Willingness§! * §YState Worth§! = §7Total State Value§! (= §Gbonuses§!).\n\nInitially you must choose a recipient. Their willingness is displayed adjacent to their name in descending order. Althought it might be tempting to choose the first recipient, keep in mind that certain demands depend on their industrial / military capacity, in which case you might receive less benefits closing a deal with a weaker nation, although they are more willing.\n  (e.g.) Infrastructure development is directly dependent on industrial capacity as well as the recipient's average infrastructure level in their owned states. Additionally, if a recipient cannot pay the entire price, some options will drop in cost or completely become unavailable.\n\nOnce a recipient has been chosen, a §ONegotiation Threshold (NT)§! and a §YStarting Negotiation Point (SNP)§! are determined. The more demands are made, the more points will be deducted from §YSNP§! eventually resulting in a §eFinal Negotiation Point (FNP)§!.

 event_info_loc_t140_b:0 "§2Introduction§!:\n §LThe §eGreek Economic Enigma§! is consisted by four (4) sub-mechanics:\n   * §7Debt to the I.F.C.§!\n   * §7National Bank of Greece§!\n   * §7Ministry of Economics§!\n   * §7Global Trade§!\n\nYou can find the custom GUI under decisions, in the homonym category.\n\nFor a full breakdown of each submechanic, refer to the later pages by right-clicking the §O(!)§! button in the top-bar right above.§!"
 event_info_loc_t141_b:0 "\n§LOverhauled compared to the base game, the new debt mechanic now initially causes:\n   * §R-20%§! §YConsumer Goods§!\n   * §R-25%§! §YStability§!\n However, §790%§! of the negative effects will be recovered once §750%§! of the debt has been paid.\n\n §3Repaying Debt Options:§!\n   §4*§! §WPay §YSmall§! Debt§!\n          Allows you to pay small chunks of debt (1/2/3) with no extra discount.\n   §4*§! §WPay §YLarge§! Debt§!\n          Allows you to pay larger chunks of debt (15/20/25) with (5/10/15)% extra discount.\n   §4*§! §WPay Debt with §YGold§!§!\n          Allows you to utilize gold from Armament Transactions to pay for debt.\n   §4*§! §W§YFreeze§! our Debt§!\n          Allows you to freeze your debt to a country for up to 2 years. This will grant §G50§! §YPolitical\n          Power§! however it will decrease §OInfluence§! with all nations, especially the\n          afflicted one. You can manually resume debt after 90 days have passed.\n   §4*§! §W§YDefault§! on Debt§!\n          Allows you to default your debt and receive its remaining value in §YPolitical Power§! instead.\n          However this will tank §OInfluence§! with all nations, especially the afflicted one.\n\n §3Debtor Reactions§!:\n   Repaying any debt towards a debtor might cause the rest to feel neglected, if there is more than §t15%§! difference in the overall debt paid. The check triggers three (3) days after paying, meaning you can pay in any order, just keep in mind to avoid the 15% gap afterwards.\n  §4Example:§!\n    §i[ITA.GetNameWithFlag]§! has §Y5%§! debt repaid, §e[FRA.GetNameWithFlag]§! has §Y15%§! and the §n[ENG.GetNameWithFlag]§! has §Y20%§!. If we are to repay another §Y5%§! debt for §nUK§!, the difference between them and §iItaly§! will be §t20%§!, which will trigger a chance-based event where the Italians will protest. If however we were to repay §Y10%§! debt, then both §iItaly§! and §eFrance§! would have a chance to protest, with Italy having a higher one due to the greater difference. However, even if we were to repay §Y10%§! debt, the check would happen about three days after, meaning paying the appropriate amount to the rest would nullify the chance of a protest-trigger.§!"
 event_info_loc_t142_b:0 "\n§L §3Repayment Scaling Bonuses§!:\n   Depending on how fast the entirety of the debt is repaid (not frozen, not defaulted), a scaling bonus will be received. In order to receive the greatest possible bonus, then the entire debt must be repaid up to §YJanuary 1st, 1938§!. Afterwards, each day the bonuses will start diminishing (linearly), with the minimum amount being granted after §YJuly 5th, 1939§!.\n\n §3Debt Cost Adjustments§!:\n   The initial cost per §O1%§! of debt is §R4.00§! £pol_power.\n     * §YLarge§! Payments provide a (§l5§!/§i10§!/§G15§!)% overall reduction.\n     * Shifting Economy §YExternally§! (§0Bank§!) reduces base cost by §G0.05§! per level.\n     * §YEmmanouíl Tsouderós§! and §YAndréas Apostolídis§! decrease overall cost by §G25%§! and §G5%§!.§!"
 event_info_loc_t143_b:0 "\n§L §3Introduction§!:\n  The §0National Bank of Greece§! sub-mechanic is tied behind §YEmmanouíl Tsouderós§!. It becomes available once hired, however, any effects will remain once he is replaced. It will just be impossible to change them till you rehire him again.\n\n §3Shifting Economy Focus§!:\n  Focus can either be shifted §eInternally§! or §tExternally§!. Each provides benefits and disadvantages which have to be weighted. Once the choice to shift is made, §Y15§! days need to pass for changes to take effect. Changes can immediately take effect by pressing the button once more and by paying §t10§!£pol_power per day remaining.§!"
 event_info_loc_t144_b:0 "\n§L §3Introduction§!:\n  The §0Ministry of Economics§! sub-mechanic is tied behind §YAndréas Apostolídis§!, similarly to the §0National Bank of Greece§! and §YEmmanouíl Tsouderós§!. The minister is responsible for the nation's §OEconomic§! and §OTrade Policy§!.\n\n §3Economic Policy§!:\n  The conventional economy policies have been replaced with §YThe Greek Economic Enigma§! as displayed in the §YLaws & Government§! panel. This restricts foreign nations from knowing the nation's actual policy, which initially starts at the level of §YCivilian Economy§!. Through §YAndréas Apostolídis§! it is possible to §OUpgrade§! or §OAnnounce§! the §Yactual§! level.\n   §4Upgrade Economy§!:\n     It takes §O60§! days to fully upgrade the economy to the next level. This comes in the form of §O5§!\n     batches and similarly to before, immediately upgrading the economy can be achieved by\n     paying §R50§!£pol_power per batch. Upgrading the economy at any time includes several risks one should\n     take into consideration. These risks can be displayed by hovering over the panels in the GUI\n    and only if §YA Game of Shadows§! is complete. An estimation of detection is even provided.\n       - The effects are provided through a hidden spirit, upgraded by each batch.\n   §4Detection§!:\n     Everytime an upgrade is commited, a detection chance is calculated by several factors.\n     Additionally, each time a batch is finished, a minor detection trigger also occurs, 5% of the\n     initial detection chance. Therefore, paying for the immediate transition will decrease\n     the overall chance to be detected.\n       - Hover over the respective options for detailed information.\n   §4Announce Economy§!:\n     This introduces some mitigation factors into the formula, which either decrease or completely\n     nullify the backslash effects. It is important to note that amidst the stable mitigation factors,\n     additional ones occur dynamically through the game that create small windows of\n     opportunity. For example the declaration of war in Poland by Germany will make it seem\n     acceptable that you took secretive actions to boost your war economy and thus reduce the\n     backslash.\n       - Hover over the respective options for detailed information.§!"
 event_info_loc_t145_b:0 "\n§L §3Introduction§!:\n  The §0Global Trade§! effects come as a replacement of the conventional §YTrade Laws§!. specifically through the §Y$ministry_of_rolling_with_the_punches_early$§! idea which cannot be removed. These effects are also strongly tied to the §0Ministry of Economics§!. Rather than receiving a set bonus based on a trade law, bonuses are now received based on various factors, such as:\n   * §OInfluence§! §g(requires §8$GRE_cooperate_with_foreign_monopolies$§! focus)§!\n   * §OResources Exported§!\n   * §OResources Imported§!\n   * §OSecured Convoys§!\n\n §3General Philosophy§!:\n   Resources (calculated in batches of 8), Convoys (batches of 50) and Influence (based on level) will provide different type of bonuses and disadvantages. For example, if exporting 24 steel (not necessary to be leased), then Factory Output will increase by 3%.\n\n §3Managing Exports§!:\n   Exports are now defined by the actual §YExport Percentage§! and the §YMinimum Exports Possible§!. Through the §0Ministry of Economics§! one can increase or decrease their §YExports§!, but not below the former variable which is adjusted by various treaties and national spirits. The more exports you have, the more resources get to the market, meaning more benefits. However, in contrast to the base game, the actual amount of resources you now have is significant.\n\n §3Secured Convoys§!:\n   The significance of the Greek merchant fleet is depicted through the secured convoys sub-mechanic. Calculated in batches of 50, scaling bonuses will be received. Secured convoys will also be guaranteed in case of capitulation, which intertwines the historical events of the time with gameplay elements.\n\n §3The Danger of Imports§!:\n   Increasing the amount of imported resources will now bring disadvantages, such as intel leaking to your enemies. §YIntel§! is a major factor closely tied to §0A Game of Shadows§! mechanic.§!"
 event_info_loc_t150_b:0 "§2Introduction§!:\n §LThe armed forces consist a plethora of sub-mechanics, many of which affiliated with other features and mechanics (e.g. conscripts). Below a brief summary of each sub-mechanic will be provided and some mechanics will be refered to their original pages. These mechanics are:\n   * §OArmed Forces Branches Effects§!\n   * §OArmed Forces Budget§!\n   * §OOfficer Overhaul§!\n     * §OAffiliation & Representation§!\n     * §OPreparation§!\n   * §OMilitary Decisions and Exercises§!\n   * §OConscripts & National Guard§!\n   * §OArms-Deals§!\n\n §3Armed Forces Branches Effects§!\n   Listed on top of the GUI in the respective category, all of the armed forces branches receive a variety of effects. Airforce and Army receive negative effects due to their horrific state, while Navy is stable and thus unaffected. There are five possible leves for each, with the latter (>3) granted after achieving huge accomplishments. The triggers to improve the branch condition are displayed by hovering over the respective button. Some additional effects are applied at the begining of the game, depicting the horrible state of the Hellenic Armed Forces. These can be mitigated by National Focuses.\n     - Army will not trigger automatically due to the tied §0Italian Aggression§! mechanic.\n\n §3Armed Forces Budget§!:\n   After completing §Y$GRE_solidify_the_budget$§! focus, you can decide on your initial budget (two choices). This will grant you some budget tokens at the cost of various effects. These tokens can be utilized to unlock several following focuses granted various effects and bonuses.\n   After completing §Y$GRE_extend_budget$§! focus, the budget will both start stabilizing and open up for further increase. Specific decisions-missions will become available (visible in capital) allowing you to speed up the recovery process. These budget choices are extremely powerful but come at a great cost.                            §!    §!"
 event_info_loc_t151_b:0 "§L §3Officer Overhaul§!:\n   The overhauled officer system introduces:\n     * (§G28§!/§l84§!) (§GHistorical§!/§lRandomly Generated§!) §7Generals§!\n     * (§46§!/§616§!) (§5Historical§!/§6Randomly Generated§!) §CAdmirals§!\n   All Generals and Admirals now have a specific ideology which comes in the form of a trait. They can either be a staunch-type ideologue (e.g. Communist) or a leaning-type (e.g. Conventional). Additionally they come with a §0Preparation§! trait, which depicts their level of readiness.\n   §4Affiliation & Representation§!:\n      A detailed representation of each ideology (& sub-ideology) is depicted in the GUI.\n      Representation in the Armed Forces Branches is crucial as it is mostly player-controlled and\n      dictates the various effects of any possible army composition. These effects can be seen in\n      detail in the bottom part of the GUI. The overall weight of each main ideology will define the\n      effects of the Hellenic Armed Forces dynamic spirit, for better or worse. This works in\n      conjuction with your §0Domestic Political Relationships§! to decide whether buffs or debuffs are\n      applied. Civil-wars will trigger based on the army composition at the time, so giving the\n      Communists too much of a representation for example, will give them a greater army.\n   §4Preparation§!\n      The Army Officer Corp comes with an additional trait, called Preparation level. This trait\n      consists of four different levels and all officers start with the lowest level possible.\n      Depending on the level of the trait the General's skillset is restricted, while it is possible for\n      them to surrender to the enemy, suffer combat penalties that even hinder them from\n      stopping an attack or retreating and even, if unlucky enough, die. Improving the Army\n      Condition is not just about improving the equipment, but the quality of the personel. In\n      order to achieve this, §0Military Exercises§! are required.\n\n §3Military Decisions & Exercises§!:\n   Divided into Training and Specialization exercises, these on-map decisions will improve your Officers' condition as well as grant them specific perks. These decisions require certain parameters to be met, such as Officers leading a minimum amount of troops. Additionally, §0Kathestós Metaxá§! provides some extra decisions, with more complex bonuses.      §!"
 event_info_loc_t152_b:0 "§L §3Conscripts & National Guard§!\n   Through Metaxás' reforms it is now possible to train off-map troops in your states. These troops can either be conscripts, who are frontline-ready troops requiring to be relocated once war erupts and national-guard, who are the local population prepared to take up arms once an invasion is launched.  The training of these units allow you to circumvert the Italian watch over your military and still be ready for the upcoming war.\n\n §3Arms-Deals§!:\n   Similar to the §0Investments§! mechanic in philosophy, arms-deals have to do with utilizing the PYRKAL co. to sell and redirect equipment to nations in need. These transactions will net you significant bonuses that will help your nation economy recover.\n   As far as the Spanish Civil war is concerned, these transactions are further enhanced through the §0Guns & Roses§! series of events, where it is possible to redirect equipment of major nations in secret towards the spanish conflict.§!"
 event_info_loc_t160_b:0 "§2Introduction§!:\n §LThe regime of Metaxás is split into four main categories in the decisions menu:\n   * §OProjects§!\n   * §OSecret Police§!\n   * §OPropaganda§!\n   * §OForeign Policy§!\n\n §3Projects§!:\n   The first main category is consisted of various projects the regime undertook. These projects will provide a variety of benefits and intertwine with multiple mechanics such as §0Workers into Factories§! & §0Invigorating Hellenic Spirit§!, §0Domestic Politics§!, §0Regime Balance of Power§!, §0Inaccessible Regions§! and so forth. Completing these projects will be tremendously important at all stages of the game and allow you to avoid Civil-War, increase faction relations, as well as open up powerful buffs once enough projects are completed. However, the cost of these projects will increase the more active projects you have at a time, making it the pursuit ever so difficult.\n\n §3Secret Police§!:\n   The decisions of the secret police have a varying utility and can be categorized into:\n     * Military Purges (which remove hostile-aligned generals)\n     * Security Decisions (improves security-related aspects)\n     * Tackling Opposition (one of the ways to stop civil-wars)\n     * Handling Minorities (e.g. can nullify Bulgarian Guerilla Events)\n   Going through some of the Secret Police branches is mandatory to ensure the regime stability and avoid a collapse, both domestically-caused or foreign-caused.\n\n §3Propaganda§!:\n   Very similar to Projects, propaganda decisions will improve the state of the nation while improving the spirits of the population. The idea and functionality of these decisions is basically the same, with of course some differences in the way the play out, in order to bring the character of a state's propaganda.               §!"
 event_info_loc_t161_b:0 "§L §3Foreign Policy§!:\n   The final category of the regime is divided into three aspects:\n     * §0Axis & Allies§!\n     * §0Balkan Pact Desirability§!\n     * §0Italian Aggression§!§!"
