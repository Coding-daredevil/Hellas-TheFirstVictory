 event_info_loc_h082_b:0 "§2Introduction§!:\n §LWhile §OGermany§! is focusing onto the §YSecond Vienna Award§!, you may attempt to intervene in favor of the Romanians, in order to save them both from losing parts of their country, as well as having their government toppled later on due to these loses.\n\n§2Mechanic§!:\n You are to present different types of 'solutions' and 'guarantees' in an effort to convince the Germans to let the matter go. Some decisions can only be taken once and at a cost. Every time a proposal is finalized some days are required in order for it to be evaluated by the Axis. If the proposal fails, a new cycle of negotiations will begin. However, if the Germans manage to complete the respective focus (70 days), your attempt will result in a failure and the Second Vienna Award (aka Vienna Diktat) will be realized as the Germans have envisioned.\n\n§2Specifics§!:\n  * §YStarting Negotiation Point (SNP)§! - §450§!\n  * §ONegotiation Threshold (NT)§!

 event_info_loc_h241_b:0 "§LThe negotiation between you and the opposing party are centered around two points. The §YState Worth§! and the §YRecipient Willingness§!.\n * §YState Worth§! defines the magnitude of benefits (derived by §7resources§!).\n * §YRecipient Willingness§! is how much they want these resources.\n     (e.g.) Certain countries like §5Germany§! desire §4Fuel§!.\n\n§YRecipient Willingness§! * §YState Worth§! = §7Total State Value§! (= §Gbonuses§!).\n\nInitially you must choose a recipient. Their willingness is displayed adjacent to their name in descending order. Althought it might be tempting to choose the first recipient, keep in mind that certain demands depend on their industrial / military capacity, in which case you might receive less benefits closing a deal with a weaker nation, although they are more willing.\n  (e.g.) Infrastructure development is directly dependent on industrial capacity as well as the recipient's average infrastructure level in their owned states. Additionally, if a recipient cannot pay the entire price, some options will drop in cost or completely become unavailable.\n\nOnce a recipient has been chosen, a §ONegotiation Threshold (NT)§! and a §YStarting Negotiation Point (SNP)§! are determined. The more demands are made, the more points will be deducted from §YSNP§! eventually resulting in a §eFinal Negotiation Point (FNP)§!. The following formula is used to calculate the fractured (between 0-100) successful outcome.\n\n                                                      §7Result§! = §Y 2 * (( 100 * §eFNP§! / §ONT§! ) - 50 )§!\n\nGenerally, the base §ONT§! will usually be §C100§!. It will also fluctuate based on §5Influence§! (-25, +25), §5AXAL Leaning§! (-20, +20), §5Collaboration Government§! (-25, 0), §5Civilian Infiltration Token§! (-15, 0).[GetEventInfoSuccessChanceBreakdownINFO]"
